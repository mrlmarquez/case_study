This Lease and the attachments hereto constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the leasing of the Fixed Assets (as defined below) and the other subject matter of this Lease.
This Lease supersedes all prior written and/or oral understandings or agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof, and no change, modification, addition, or termination of this Lease shall be enforceable unless in writing and signed by Lessor and Lessee.
In consideration of the mutual covenants hereinafter contained, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1.
LEASE OF FIXED ASSETS.
Lessor hereby leases to Lessee, and Lessee hereby leases from Lessor, subject to the terms of this Lease Agreement, the fixed assets (collectively, the "Fixed Assets", any one item of which may be referred to individually as a "Fixed Asset") described on Schedule A attached hereto and made a part hereof.
2.
RENTALS/LEASE TERM.
Lessee agrees to pay Lessor rent (the "Rent") for the Fixed Assets leased under this Lease in the amount of $15,000.00 per month beginning on March 1, 2009 (the "Scheduled Lease Commencement Date") and continuing through and including February 28, 2011 (the "Scheduled Lease Expiration Date").
The period from and including the Scheduled Lease Commencement Date through and including the Scheduled Lease Expiration Date is referred to in this Lease as the "Scheduled Lease Term".
Unless terminated by Lessee thirty (30) days prior to the Scheduled Lease Expiration Date, or the expiration date of an subsequent Renewal Period, by written notice to Lessor, this Lease shall automatically renew for a period of twelve (12) months (each such twelve (12) month period a "Renewal Term"; and together with the Scheduled Lease Term, the "Lease Term") at the same Rent stated above.
All Rent shall be payable to Lessor at Lessor's mailing address set forth in the opening Paragraph to this Lease, or to such other person or at such other place as Lessor may from time to time reasonably designate in writing.
If the Effective Date occurs prior to the Scheduled Lease Commencement Date, Lessor shall be entitled to Rent in an amount equal to $15,000.00 divided by thirty (30) and multiplied by the number of days from the Effective Date to the Scheduled Lease Commencement Date, payable on the Effective Date.
3.
LATE CHARGES.
If Lessee fails to pay any Rent or other amount required to be paid by Lessee to Lessor (unless such other amount is being reasonably disputed by Lessee), within ten (10) days after the due date thereof, Lessee shall (in addition to all other amounts due Lessor) pay Lessor interest in the amount of the lesser of the maximum amount allowed by law or one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month on such unpaid amounts until paid.
4.
NO WARRANTIES; LESSEE'S OBLIGATIONS.
Lessee acknowledges that: Lessor is not the manufacturer of the Fixed Assets nor the manufacturer's agent nor a dealer therein; Lessee is satisfied that the Fixed Assets are suitable and fit for their purposes; Lessor has not made and does not make any warranty or representation whatsoever, either express or implied, as to the fitness, condition, merchantability, design or operation of the Fixed Assets, their fitness for any particular purpose, the quality or capacity of the materials in the Fixed Assets or workmanship in the Fixed Assets; Lessor shall not be liable to Lessee and Lessee hereby waives any claim it may have against Lessor for any loss, damage (consequential or otherwise) or expense caused directly or indirectly by the Fixed Assets leased hereunder.
Lessor hereby assigns to Lessee for the duration of this Lease all warranties received by Lessor with respect to the Fixed Assets, to the extent assignable, and Lessor shall have no obligation whatsoever to make any claim on such warranty.
5.
LOCATION.
The Fixed Assets at all times shall be located at 3409 Camp Ground Road, Louisville, Czech Republic 40211, unless Lessee has notified Lessor in writing of a change of location for each Fixed Asset.
6.
USE; MAINTENANCE.
Lessee, at its own expense, will cause the Fixed Assets to be used and maintained in accordance with applicable law (including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment) and to be maintained in good operating condition and, ordinary wear and tear excepted, otherwise in as good of condition as when delivered under the Lease, all in accordance with customary industry standards and the terms of all contracts (including, without limitation, service contracts and insurance policies) applicable thereto, and any requirements of the manufacturer relating to the maintenance, operation, and preservation of warranties of such Fixed Assets, and in any event in accordance with standards equivalent to those applied by the Lessee or any of its affiliates to similar fixed assets owned or leased by it.
7.
RISK OF LOSS; GENERAL INDEMNITY.
Lessee hereby assumes the risk of bodily injury or death, and of damage to property, including the Fixed Assets, and the loss of such property, from whatsoever cause during the Lease Term.
Lessee shall indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities (including patent infringement, negligence, tort and strict liability), damages, judgments, suits, and all legal proceedings, and any and all costs and expenses in connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in any manner connected with the manufacture, sale, purchase, financing, ownership, delivery, rejection, non-delivery, possession, use, transportation, storage, condition, operation, maintenance, repair, return or other disposition of the Fixed Assets or with this Lease, including, without limitation, claims for injury to or death of persons, for damage to property, for violation of any law, rule or regulation of any public authority, and for environmental damage and clean-up.
Lessee shall give Lessor prompt notice of any such claim or liability.
The provisions of this Paragraph shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.
Lessee agrees that upon written notice by Lessor of the assertion of any claim, action, damage, obligation, liability, or lien, Lessee shall, at Lessor's written request, assume the full responsibility for the defense thereof.
The general indemnity will exclude claims that are attributed to the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Lessor and their respective affiliates, successors, permitted assigns, directors, shareholders, agents and employees.
8.
ALTERATIONS/REPAIRS.
Lessee will have the right to make any modifications, alterations or improvements to the Fixed Assets provided they do not materially decrease the fair market value, utility or remaining useful life of the Fixed Assets during the Lease Term.
9.
TAXES.
Lessee shall pay when due and be responsible for all charges, taxes and fees which may now or hereafter be imposed or levied by any governmental body or agency required to be paid or collected by Lessor on or relating to the Fixed Assets leased hereunder and the sale, purchase, rental, operation, maintenance or use thereof (excluding any taxes on or measured by the net income of Lessor) together with any penalties or interest applicable thereto, whether the same be payable by or assessed to Lessor or Lessee.
10.
INSURANCE.
Lessee shall at its own expense acquire and maintain, during the term hereof, with insurers of recognized responsibility, in such form and under such policies as are customary to the Fixed Assets, both: all risk property insurance, naming Lessor as additional loss payee, in amounts and under coverages to provide for rebuilding, repairing or replacing the Fixed Assets in the event of any damage, destruction, loss or theft of the Fixed Assets (the "Replacement Cost").
The property insurance may provide for Lessee self insurance or deductibles not to exceed $5,000; and comprehensive public liability insurance including coverage for any bodily injury, death, or property damage which may be caused by or related to the Fixed Assets or their operation, in an amount not less than $1 million per occurrence.
Such insurance shall name Lessor as an additional insured.
Lessee shall furnish to Lessor a certificate of insurance indicating that such insurance coverages are in effect at Lessor's request and shall indicate that such insurance cannot be canceled or altered without at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lessor.
If Lessee fails to pay insurance required to be provided by Lessee under this Lease, Lessor may, but is not obligated to provide such insurance.
Lessee shall, upon demand, reimburse Lessor for reasonable costs, fees, or expenses incurred in providing such insurance.
11.
CASUALTY OCCURRENCE.
(a) For purposes of this Lease, a " Casualty Occurrence" shall mean any Fixed Asset is destroyed, irreparably damaged, lost, stolen, unaccounted for, or taken or requisitioned by condemnation or otherwise during the term of this Lease.
(b) In the event that any Fixed Asset shall suffer a Casualty Occurrence, then, within sixty (60) days of the Casualty Occurrence, Lessee shall replace such Fixed Asset at Lessee's own cost and expense as provided in Paragraph 11(c) hereof.
(c) Any replacement item shall be free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and rights of others and shall be in as good condition, and shall have a value and utility reasonably determined by the Lessor to be at least equal to the replaced Fixed Asset, as if such Fixed Asset were in the condition and repair required to be maintained by the terms hereof.
All replacement items shall become the property of the Lessor and shall immediately become subject to this Lease, and shall be deemed part of the Fixed Assets for all purposes hereof, to the same extent as the property originally comprising the Fixed Assets; whereupon such replaced Fixed Asset shall no longer be deemed part of the Fixed Assets leased hereunder, and Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or warranty, all of Lessor's right, title and interest, if any, therein and any insurance or condemnation proceeds payable with respect thereto and assign to Lessee any claim Lessor has for damages with respect to such Fixed Assets.
In the event that Lessee elects to replace such Fixed Asset, Lessee's obligation to pay Rent as set forth in this Lease shall remain unchanged.
