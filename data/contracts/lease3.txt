Adjustment of Commencement Date; Possession.
3.01 If Landlord is required to perform Landlord Work prior to the Commencement Date: (a) the date set forth in Section 1.06 as the Commencement Date shall instead be defined as the �Target Commencement Date�; (b) the actual Commencement Date shall be the date on which the Landlord Work is Substantially Complete (defined below); and (c) the Termination Date will be the last day of the Term as determined based upon the actual Commencement Date.
Landlord�s failure to Substantially Complete the Landlord Work by the Target Commencement Date shall not be a default by Landlord or otherwise render Landlord liable for damages.
Promptly after the determination of the Commencement Date, Landlord and Tenant shall enter into a commencement letter agreement in the form attached as Exhibit D. If the Termination Date does not fall on the last day of a calendar month, Landlord and Tenant may elect to adjust the Termination Date to the last day of the calendar month in which Termination Date occurs by the mutual execution of a commencement letter agreement setting forth such adjusted date.
The Landlord Work shall be deemed to be �Substantially Complete� on the date that all Landlord Work has been performed, other than any details of construction, mechanical adjustment or any other similar matter, the non-completion of which does not materially interfere with Tenant�s use of the Premises.
If Landlord is delayed in the performance of the Landlord Work as a result of the acts or omissions of Tenant, the Tenant Related Parties (defined in Section 13) or their respective contractors or vendors, including, without limitation, changes requested by Tenant to approved plans, Tenant�s failure to comply with any of its obligations under this Lease, or the specification of any materials or equipment with long lead times (a �Tenant Delay�), the Landlord Work shall be deemed to be Substantially Complete on the date that Landlord could reasonably have been expected to Substantially Complete the Landlord Work absent any Tenant Delay.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commencement Date does not occur within 30 days after the Target Commencement Date, unless due to Tenant Delay, Tenant shall be entitled to one (1) day of Rent abatement for each day that elapses following the expiration of such 30-day period) as the same may be extended by reason of Tenant Delay) until the occurrence of the Commencement Date, and provided, further, that if the Commencement Date does not occur within 90 days of the Target Commencement Date for any reason other than Tenant Delay, Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease by giving Landlord written notice of such election at any time after the expiration of such 90-day period (as the same may be extended by reason of Tenant Delay) and before the occurrence of the Commencement Date.
If Tenant so elects, then this Lease shall terminate on the day that is 10
days after delivery of such notice to Landlord unless the Commencement Date occurs on or before the expiration of such 10-day period, in which event Tenant�s termination election shall automatically become void.
3.02 Subject to Landlord�s obligation to perform Landlord Work, as defined in Exhibit C, the Premises are accepted by Tenant in �as-is� condition and configuration without any representations or warranties by Landlord.
By taking possession of the Premises, Tenant agrees that the Premises are in good order and satisfactory condition.
If Tenant takes possession of the Premises before the Commencement Date for the purpose of conducting business in the Premises for the Permitted Use, such possession shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Lease and Tenant shall pay Rent (defined in Section 4.01) to Landlord for each day of possession before the Commencement Date.
However, except for the cost of services requested by Tenant (e.g.
freight elevator usage), Tenant shall not be required to pay Rent for any days of possession before the Commencement Date during which Tenant, with the approval of Landlord, is in possession of the Premises for the sole purpose of performing improvements or installing furniture, equipment or other personal property.
Landlord represents that the Premises may be used for the Permitted Use under applicable zoning laws.
Landlord agrees that, as of the Commencement Date, all utilities and facilities located within or serving the Premises shall be in good working order and condition.
4.

Tenant shall pay and be liable for all rental, sales and use taxes (but excluding income taxes), if any, imposed upon or measured by Rent.
Base Rent and recurring monthly charges of Additional Rent shall be due and payable in advance on the first day of each calendar month without notice or demand, provided that the installment of Base Rent for the first full calendar month of the Term, and the first monthly installment of Additional Rent for Expenses and Taxes, shall be payable upon the execution of this Lease by Tenant.
All other items of Rent shall be due and payable by Tenant on or before 30 days after billing by Landlord.
Rent shall be made payable to the entity, and sent to the address, Landlord designates and shall be made by good and sufficient check or by other means acceptable to Landlord.
Tenant shall pay Landlord an administration fee equal to 5% of all past due Rent, provided that Tenant shall be entitled to a grace period of 5 days for the first 2 late payments of Rent in a calendar year.
In addition, past due Rent shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the so-called prime rate of interest charged from time to time by Bank of America, N.A.
or its successor plus three percent (3%) per annum from the due date until actually paid.
Landlord�s acceptance of less than the correct amount of Rent shall be considered a payment on account of the earliest Rent due.
Rent for any partial month during the Term shall be prorated.
No endorsement or statement on a check or letter accompanying payment shall be considered an accord and satisfaction.
Tenant�s covenant to pay Rent is independent of every other covenant in this Lease, except as may be expressly otherwise provided in this Lease.
4.02 Tenant shall pay Tenant�s Pro Rata Share of Taxes and Expenses in accordance Exhibit B of this Lease.
5.

The Premises shall be used for the Permitted Use and for no other use whatsoever.
Tenant shall comply with all statutes, codes, ordinances, orders, rules and regulations of any municipal or governmental entity whether in effect now or later, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (� ADA�), (�Law(s)�), regarding the operation of Tenant�s business and the use, condition, configuration and occupancy of the Premises.
In addition, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly comply with any Laws that relate to the �Base Building� (defined below), but only to the extent such obligations are triggered by Tenant�s use of the Premises, other than for general office use, or Alterations or improvements in the Premises performed or requested by Tenant (other than the Landlord Work).

Landlord agrees that it will not enforce such rules and regulations on a basis that discriminates against Tenant.
Tenant, at its expense and after notice to Landlord, may contest, by appropriate proceedings prosecuted diligently and in good faith, the validity, or applicability to the Premises, of any law or requirement of any public authority, provided that (a) Landlord shall not be subject to criminal penalty or to prosecution for a crime or subject to any civil liability, nor shall the Premises or any part thereof, or the Building, or any part thereof, be subject to being condemned or vacated, nor shall the Building, or any part thereof, be subjected to any lien (unless Tenant shall remove such lien by bonding or otherwise) or encumbrance, by reason of noncompliance or otherwise by reason of such contest; (b) before the commencement of such contest, Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against the cost thereof and against all liability for damages, Interest, penalties and expenses (including reasonable attorneys� fees and expenses) resulting from or incurred in connection with such contest or noncompliance; (c) such noncompliance or contest shall not prevent Landlord from obtaining or keeping in effect any and all permits and licenses in connection with the operation of the Building; and (d) Tenant shall keep Landlord advised as to the status of such proceedings.

6.
Security Deposit.
The Security Deposit shall be delivered to Landlord upon the execution of this Lease by Tenant and held by Landlord without liability for interest (unless required by Law) as security for the performance of Tenant�s obligations.
The Security Deposit is not an advance payment of Rent or a measure of damages.
Landlord may use all or a portion of the Security Deposit to satisfy past due Rent (following the expiration of notice and grace periods) or to cure any Default (defined in Section 18) by Tenant.
If Landlord uses any portion of the Security Deposit, Tenant shall, within 5 days after demand, restore the Security Deposit to its original amount.
Landlord shall return any unapplied portion of the Security Deposit to Tenant within 30 days after the later to occur of: (a) determination of the final Rent due from Tenant; or (b) the later to occur of the Termination Date or the date Tenant surrenders the Premises to Landlord in compliance with Section 25.
Landlord may assign the Security Deposit to a successor or transferee and, following the assignment, Landlord shall have no further liability for the return of the Security Deposit.
Landlord shall not be required to keep the Security Deposit separate from its other accounts.
7.
Building Services.
7.01 Landlord shall furnish Tenant with the following services: (a) hot and cold water for use in the Base Building lavatories, and cold water only for use in the kitchen sink; (b) customary heat and air conditioning in season during Building Service Hours; provided that Tenant shall have the right to receive HVAC service during hours other than Building Service Hours by paying Landlord�s then standard charge for additional HVAC service so long as Tenant requests same by written notice to Landlord not later than 12:00 noon on the Business Day preceding the day of such overtime usage (provided, however, that Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to provide overtime service requested not later than 12:00 noon on the day of such overtime usage); (c) standard janitorial service on Business Days; (d) Elevator service; (e) Electricity in accordance with the terms and conditions in Section 7.02; and (f) such other services as Landlord reasonably determines are necessary or appropriate for the Property.
As of the date hereof, Landlord�s charge for after-Building Service Hours heating service is $100.00 per hour, and Landlord�s charge for after-Building Service Hours air conditioning service is $100.00 per hour, (which Landlord represents are the actual costs of providing such services, including maintenance and depreciation but excluding any mark-up for profit or administrative charges), in each case for the entire Premises, subject to change from time to time.
Tenant and its employees shall have access to the Building 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, subject to the terms of this Lease and such security or monitoring systems as Landlord may reasonably impose.
7.02 Electricity shall be distributed to the Premises either by the electric utility company selected by Landlord to provide electricity service for the Building or, at Landlord�s option, by Landlord; and Landlord shall permit Landlord�s wires and conduits, to the extent available, suitable and safely capable, to be used for such distribution.
If and so long as Landlord is distributing electricity to the Premises, Tenant shall obtain all of its electricity from Landlord and shall pay all of Landlord�s charges, which charges shall be based, at Landlord�s option, either on meter readings or on Landlord�s reasonable estimate of Tenant�s electrical usage or on Tenant�s pro rata share of all space, including the Premises, which is commonly metered with the Premises.
In calculating such charges, there shall be included all commercially reasonable costs to Landlord to obtain electric service to the Building, including all commercially reasonable costs of whatever nature incurred in connection with entering agreements for obtaining such service from utility suppliers.
Initially, such charges will be based on Landlord�s estimated cost of $1.75 per annum per rentable square foot of floor area in the
Premises.
Upon Tenant�s prior written request from time to time, Landlord shall make copies of Landlord�s electric bills available to Tenant for review.
If the electric utility company selected by Landlord to provide electricity service for the Building is distributing electricity to the Premises, Landlord may elect to require Tenant, at its cost, to make all necessary arrangements with such electric utility company for metering and paying for electric current furnished to the Premises.
All electricity used during the performance of janitorial service, or the making of any alterations or repairs in or to the Premises, or the operation of any special air conditioning system serving the Premises, shall be paid by Tenant.
7.03 Landlord has advised Tenant that presently NStar Electric (the � Electric Service Provider�) is the electric utility company selected by Landlord to provide electricity service for the Building.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord reserves the right at any time and from time to time before or during the Term to either contract for electric service from a different company or companies providing electricity service (each such company shall hereinafter be referred to as an �Alternative Service Provider�) or continue to contract for electricity service from the Electric Service Provider.
Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord, the Electric Service Provider and any Alternative Service Provider at all times and, as reasonably necessary, shall allow Landlord, the Electric Service Provider and any Alternative Service Provider reasonable access to the Building�s electric lines, feeders, risers, wiring and other machinery within the Premises.
Without the consent of Landlord, Tenant�s use of electrical service shall not exceed, either in voltage, rated capacity, use beyond Building Service Hours or overall load, that which Landlord reasonably deems to be standard for the Building, which shall not be less than five (5) watts per rentable square foot, exclusive of HVAC.
Landlord shall have the right to measure electrical usage by commonly accepted methods.
If it is determined that Tenant is using excess electricity, Tenant shall pay Landlord for the cost of such excess electrical usage as Additional Rent.
7.04 Landlord�s failure to furnish, or any interruption, diminishment or termination of services due to the application of Laws, the failure of any equipment, the performance of repairs, improvements or alterations, utility interruptions or the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure (defined in Section 26.03) (collectively a � Service Failure�) shall not render Landlord liable to Tenant, constitute a constructive eviction of Tenant, give rise to an abatement of Rent, nor relieve Tenant from the obligation to fulfill any covenant or agreement.
However, if, as a result of a Service Failure that is reasonably within the control of Landlord to correct, the Premises are made untenantable for a period in excess of 3 consecutive Business Days after Tenant notifies Landlord of such failure, then Tenant, as its sole remedy, shall be entitled to receive an abatement of Rent payable hereunder during the period beginning on the 4th consecutive Business Day after Tenant so notifies Landlord and ending on the day the service has been restored.
If the entire Premises have not been rendered untenantable by the Service Failure, the amount of abatement shall be equitably prorated.
8.
Leasehold Improvements.
All improvements in and to the Premises, including any Alterations (collectively, � Leasehold Improvements�) shall remain upon the Premises at the end of the Term without compensation to Tenant.
Landlord, however, by written notice to Tenant at the time Tenant requests Landlord�s consent, may require Tenant, at its expense, to remove (a) any Cable (defined in Section 9.01) installed by or for the benefit of Tenant, and (b) any Alterations that, in Landlord�s reasonable judgment, are of a nature that would require removal and repair costs that are materially in excess of the removal and repair costs associated with standard office
improvements (collectively referred to as � Required Removables�).
Required Removables may include, without limitation, internal stairways, raised floors, personal baths and showers, vaults, rolling file systems and structural alterations and modifications.
The designated Required Removables shall be removed by Tenant before the Termination Date.
Tenant shall repair damage caused by the installation or removal of Required Removables.
If Tenant fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner, Landlord may perform such work at Tenant�s expense.
9.
Repairs and Alterations.
9.01 Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, perform all maintenance and repairs to the Premises that are not Landlord�s express responsibility under this Lease, and keep the Premises in good condition and repair, reasonable wear and tear excepted.

To the extent Landlord is not reimbursed by insurance proceeds, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the cost of repairing damage to the Building caused by the negligence or misconduct of Tenant, Tenant Related Parties and their respective contractors and vendors.
If Tenant fails to make any repairs to the Premises for more than 30 days after notice from Landlord (although notice shall not be required in an emergency) or such additional time as may be necessary in the event the repair is of such a nature that it is not capable of cure within 30 days so long as Tenant commences to repair within such 30 days and diligently pursues such repair thereafter to completion, Landlord may make the repairs, and Tenant shall pay the reasonable cost of the repairs, together with an administrative charge in an amount equal to 10% of the cost of the repairs.
9.02 Landlord shall keep and maintain in good repair and working order and perform maintenance upon the: (a) structural elements of the Building; (b) mechanical (including HVAC), electrical, plumbing and fire/life safety systems serving the Building in general; (c) Common Areas; (d) roof of the Building; (e) exterior windows of the Building; and (f) elevators serving the Building.
Landlord shall promptly make repairs for which Landlord is responsible.
9.03 Tenant shall not make alterations, repairs, additions or improvements or install any Cable (collectively referred to as � Alterations�) without first obtaining the written consent of Landlord in each instance, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
However, Landlord�s consent shall not be required for any Alteration that satisfies all of the following criteria (a �Cosmetic Alteration�): (a) is of a cosmetic nature such as painting, wallpapering, hanging pictures and installing carpeting; (b) is not visible from the exterior of the Premises or Building; (c) will not affect the Base Building; and (d) does not require work to be performed inside the walls, below the floor, or above the ceiling of the Premises.
Cosmetic Alterations shall be subject to all the other provisions of this Section 9.03, except as otherwise set forth herein.
Prior to starting work, Tenant shall furnish Landlord with plans and specifications for the proposed Alterations (other than for Cosmetic Alterations unless Tenant elects to prepare plans or specifications therefor); names of contractors reasonably acceptable to Landlord (provided that Landlord may designate specific contractors with respect to Base Building); required permits and approvals; evidence of contractor�s and subcontractor�s insurance in amounts reasonably required by Landlord and naming Landlord as an additional insured; and any security for performance in amounts reasonably required by Landlord for all
Alterations costing in excess of $25,000.00.
Changes to the plans and specifications must also be submitted to Landlord for its approval.
Alterations shall be constructed in a good and workmanlike manner using materials of a quality reasonably approved by Landlord.
Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for any reasonable sums paid by Landlord for third party examination of Tenant�s plans for non-Cosmetic Alterations.
In addition, Tenant shall pay Landlord a fee for Landlord�s oversight and coordination of any Alterations other than Cosmetic Alterations equal to 10% of the cost of the Alterations.
Upon completion, Tenant shall furnish �as-built� plans for all Alterations other than Cosmetic Alterations, completion affidavits and full and final waivers of lien.
Landlord�s approval of an Alteration shall not be deemed a representation by Landlord that the Alteration complies with Law.
10.
Entry by Landlord.
Landlord may enter the Premises to inspect, to show (but not to prospective tenants except during the last year of the Term), or to clean the Premises or to perform or facilitate the performance of repairs, alterations or additions to the Premises or any portion of the Building.
Except in emergencies or to provide Building services, Landlord shall provide Tenant with reasonable prior verbal notice of entry and shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Tenant�s use of the Premises.
If reasonably necessary, Landlord may temporarily close all or a portion of the Premises to perform repairs, alterations and additions.
However, except in emergencies, Landlord will not close the Premises if the work can reasonably be completed on weekends and after Building Service Hours.
Entry by Landlord shall not constitute a constructive eviction or entitle Tenant to an abatement or reduction of Rent.
11.
Assignment and Subletting.
11.01 Except in connection with a Permitted Transfer (defined in Section 11.04), Tenant shall not assign, sublease, transfer or encumber any interest in this Lease or allow any third party to use any portion of the Premises (collectively or individually, a �Transfer�) without the prior written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed if Landlord does not exercise its recapture rights under Section 11.02.
If the entity which controls the voting shares/rights of Tenant changes at any time, such change of ownership or control shall constitute a Transfer unless Tenant is an entity whose outstanding stock is listed on a recognized securities exchange or if at least 80% of its voting stock is owned by another entity, the voting stock of which is so listed.
Any attempted Transfer in violation of this Section is voidable by Landlord.
In no event shall any Transfer, including a Permitted Transfer, release or relieve Tenant from any obligation under this Lease.
11.02 Tenant shall provide Landlord with financial statements for the proposed transferee, a fully executed copy of the proposed assignment, sublease or other Transfer documentation and such other information as Landlord may reasonably request.

If Landlord exercises its right to recapture, this Lease shall automatically be amended (or terminated if the entire Premises is being assigned or sublet) to delete the applicable portion of the Premises effective on the proposed effective date of the Transfer, and Tenant shall have no further liability with respect to such space except for (i) those obligations that by their terms survive the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease and (ii) Tenant�s indemnity obligations under the Lease, including, without limitation, Sections 5, 13, 26.06 and 26.14 hereof.
Tenant shall pay Landlord a review fee of $1,500.00 for Landlord�s review of any Permitted Transfer or requested Transfer, except in the event of a recapture by Landlord.
11.03 Tenant shall pay Landlord 50% of all rent and other consideration which Tenant receives as a result of a Transfer that is in excess of the Rent payable to Landlord for the portion of the Premises and Term covered by the Transfer.
Tenant shall pay Landlord for Landlord�s share of the excess within 30 days after Tenant�s receipt of the excess.
Tenant may deduct from the excess, on a straight-line basis, all reasonable and customary expenses directly incurred by Tenant attributable to the Transfer.
If Tenant is in Default, Landlord may require that all sublease payments be made directly to Landlord, in which case Tenant shall receive a credit against Rent in the amount of Tenant�s share of payments received by Landlord.
11.04 Tenant may assign this Lease to a successor to Tenant by purchase, merger, consolidation or reorganization (an � Ownership Change�) or assign this Lease or sublet all or a portion of the Premises to an Affiliate without the consent of Landlord, provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied (a �Permitted Transfer�): (a) Tenant is not in Default; (b) in the event of an Ownership Change, Tenant�s successor shall own substantially all of the assets of Tenant and have a net worth which is at least equal to Tenant�s net worth as of the day prior to the proposed Ownership Change; (c) the Permitted Use does not allow the Premises to be used for retail purposes; and (d) Tenant shall give Landlord written notice at least 15 Business Days prior to the effective date of the Permitted Transfer.
Tenant�s notice to Landlord shall include information and documentation evidencing the Permitted Transfer and showing that each of the above conditions has been satisfied.
If requested by Landlord, Tenant�s successor shall sign a commercially reasonable form of assumption agreement.
�Affiliate� shall mean an entity controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant (for such period of time as such entity continues to be controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant, it being agreed that the subsequent sale or transfer of stock resulting in a change in voting control, or any other transaction(s) having the overall effect that such entity ceases to be controlled by, controlling or under common control with Tenant, shall be treated as if such sale or transfer or transaction(s) were, for all purposes, an assignment of this Lease governed by the provisions of this Article 11).
12.
Liens.
Tenant shall not permit mechanics� or other liens to be placed upon the Property, Premises or Tenant�s leasehold interest in connection with any work or service done or purportedly done by or for the benefit of Tenant or its transferees.

Tenant shall pay Tenant�s Pro Rata Share of the amount, if any, by which Expenses (defined below) for each calendar year during the Term exceed Expenses for the Base Year (the � Expense Excess�) and also the amount, if any, by which Taxes (defined below) for each Fiscal Year during the Term exceed Taxes for the Base Year (the �Tax Excess�).
If Expenses or Taxes in any calendar year or Fiscal Year decrease below the amount of Expenses or Taxes for the Base Year, Tenant�s Pro Rata Share of Expenses or Taxes, as the case may be, for that calendar year or Fiscal Year shall be $0.
Landlord shall provide Tenant with a good faith estimate of the Expense Excess and of the Tax Excess for each calendar year or Fiscal Year during the Term.
On or before the first day of each month, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a monthly installment equal to one-twelfth of Tenant�s Pro Rata Share of Landlord�s estimate of both the Expense Excess and Tax Excess.
After its receipt of the revised estimate, Tenant�s monthly payments shall be based upon the revised estimate.
If Landlord does not provide Tenant with an estimate of the Expense Excess or the Tax Excess by January 1 of a calendar year, Tenant shall continue to pay monthly installments based on the previous year�s estimate(s) until Landlord provides Tenant with the new estimate.
1.02.
As soon as is practical following the end of each calendar year or Fiscal Year, as the case may be, Landlord shall furnish Tenant with a statement of the actual Expenses and Expense Excess and the actual Taxes and Tax Excess for the prior calendar year or Fiscal Year, as the case may be.
If the estimated Expense Excess or estimated Tax Excess for the prior calendar year or Fiscal Year, as the case may be, is more than the actual Expense Excess or actual Tax Excess for the prior calendar year or Fiscal Year, as the case may be, Landlord shall either provide Tenant with a refund or apply any overpayment by Tenant against Additional Rent due or next becoming due, provided if the Term expires before the determination of the overpayment, Landlord shall refund any overpayment to Tenant after first deducting the amount of Rent due.
If the estimated Expense Excess or estimated Tax Excess for the prior calendar year or Fiscal Year, as the case may be, is less than the actual Expense Excess or actual Tax Excess, for such prior calendar year or Fiscal year, as the case may be, for such prior year, Tenant shall pay Landlord, within 30 days after its receipt of the statement of Expenses or Taxes, any underpayment for the prior calendar year.
