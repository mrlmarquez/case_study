13.4 In addition, such insurance shall specifically name Lessor as an additional insured party and shall be primary to any and all other insurance of Lessor with respect to any and all claims and demands which may be made against Lessor and its officers, directors, employees and agents, whether on account of injury or death of any person or persons, damage to or loss of property, violation of law or regulation or otherwise, in any way arising out of, related to or attributed to, directly or indirectly, Lessee�s occupation of the Surface Premises under this Lease.
Lessor reserves the right to approve the specific endorsement wording granting Lessor Additional Insured

14
status on all of the Lessee�s applicable and/or required insurance policies.
Such insurance shall specifically provide that it applies separately to each insured against which claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of liability.
13.5 Lessee shall remain in compliance with the terms of this Paragraph 13 throughout the term of this Lease, as well as at all times that Lessee remains on the Surface Premises for any reason, including without limitation, for the purpose of performing its obligation to restore the Surface Premises to its original state and performing all required reclamation work.
14.0 Termination on Default.
14.1 If Lessee shall make any default in payment of any sums that may be due to Lessor under this Lease, then in such case Lessee shall be considered in default of this Lease.
If any such default shall continue for fifteen (15) days after receipt of written notice and demand from Lessor to remedy the same, or if any such default is not capable of being cured within the fifteen (15) day time period, that Lessee is diligently working to cure such default, then upon written notice by Lessor of its intent to terminate this Lease, this Lease shall immediately cease and terminate and the Lease shall be of no further force or effect.
14.2 If Lessee shall fail in any other respect to comply with the terms and conditions of this Lease, then in such case Lessee shall be considered in default of this Lease.
If Lessee fails to demonstrate that it has cured any such default within thirty (30) days from the receipt of written notice and demand from Lessor to remedy the same, or if any such default is not capable of being cured within the thirty (30) day time period, that Lessee is diligently working to cure such default, then upon written notice by Lessor of its intent to terminate this Lease, this Lease shall immediately cease and terminate and the Lease shall be of no further force or effect.
14.3 If, during the first Twenty (20) years of the Term of this Lease, default be made by Lessee (or any of its permitted successors or assigns) in the performance of any of the terms or conditions of either of the Coal Leases, and such default is not cured within any applicable cure period in the such lease, then in such event, Lessor may, at its option, terminate this Lease without any further notice and re-enter upon and take possession of the Surface Premises without initiation of legal process, and thereafter re-let the same or any part thereof for the balance of the Term hereof, or any part thereof, upon such conditions as Lessor may deem proper, and Lessor may hold and possess the same as its absolute property free and clear of any claims of, by or through Lessee, and pursue any and all other remedies available under the statutory or common laws of the State of Illinois for violations of any covenant or condition hereof, and all such remedies shall be deemed cumulative and not exclusive.
Lessee shall notify Lessor of its proposed cure actions and continue to keep Lessor informed on a regular basis of the actions taken and results thereof.
15
14.4 If Lessee shall (1) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee or liquidator of itself or of all or a substantial part of its assets; or (2) be unable, or admit in writing, its inability to pay its debts as they mature, or (3) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (4) be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent or dissolved; or (5) file a petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization or for an arrangement pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or any similar Federal or State law now or hereafter in effect; or (6) file an answer admitting the material allegations or consent to or default in answering a petition filed against it in any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency proceeding, or corporate action shall be taken for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; or (7) if an order, judgment or decree shall be entered, without the application, approval or consent of Lessee, by a court of competent jurisdiction, approving a petition seeking reorganization of Lessee or appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator of Lessee or of all or a substantial part of its assets, and such order, judgment or decree shall continue unstayed and in effect for any period of thirty (30) consecutive days; then Lessee shall be deemed in default and Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Lease at any time thereafter by giving Lessee written notice of such termination, and upon the giving of such notice, this Lease and the rights herein granted to Lessee shall terminate.
15.0 Remedies Upon Default.
15.1 The remedies under this Lease shall be cumulative, rather than exclusive, and Lessor shall have upon Lessee�s failure to timely cure any event of default under Paragraph 14.0 the right to exercise, in addition to any and all rights available under Illinois statutory law or common law or otherwise available under this Lease, the option to terminate this Lease, re-enter and take possession of the Surface Premises without initiation of legal process, and thereafter re-let the same or any part thereof for the balance of the Term hereof, or any part thereof, upon such conditions as Lessor may deem proper.
Neither re-entry nor re-letting shall discharge Lessee from any payments due to Lessor at the time of termination or re-entry, or from any unsatisfied obligation of the Lessee under this Lease.
15.2 No termination or re-entry hereunder by Lessor shall bar the recovery of damages for the breach of any of the terms, conditions or covenants on the part of Lessee herein contained.
The failure of Lessor to recognize any act constituting a default by Lessee hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of its rights later to act hereon or on any other default by Lessee hereunder.
16.0 Removal of Equipment.
16.1 Upon the expiration of this Lease, and upon the condition that:

16
(a) All sums of money due the Lessor by the Lessee have been paid, and
(b) All of Lessee�s covenants and obligations under this Lease have been fully kept and performed to Lessor�s reasonable satisfaction, and Lessee is not in default of any term or condition herein at the time of the expiration of this Lease, then:
Lessee shall have the obligation to remove from the Surface Premises within ninety (90) days after said expiration all of Lessee�s structures, equipment, machinery, improvements and other property Lessee may have placed on the Surface Premises during the term of this Lease.
16.2 If Lessee does not remove said structures, equipment, machinery, improvements, and other property of Lessee from the Surface Premises, as provided above, Lessee irrevocably agrees that Lessor, at its sole option, shall be deemed the sole owner of said property remaining on the Surface Premises, and Lessor shall have the additional right, at its sole option, to remove the property at Lessee�s expense or to sell such of Lessee�s property remaining on the Surface Premises as is necessary to defray the cost(s) of removal of all or any part of the remaining aforementioned property.
17.0 Lessor�s Right of Inspection.
Lessor shall have, at all reasonable times during the term of this Lease on prior notice to Lessee, access to the Surface Premises at Lessor�s sole risk, to make such inspections of the Surface Premises and operations being conducted as it deems desirable to ensure that such operations are being performed in accordance with the obligations of Lessee hereunder.
Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that any inspection or approval given by Lessor or Lessor�s representative shall relieve Lessee from any of its obligations hereunder.
18.0 Force Majeure.
18.1 The term �Force Majeure� as used herein, shall mean a nationwide strike in the coal industry or a strike at the mine or facilities on the Surface Premises, work stoppages due to labor organizing efforts, acts of God, acts of a public enemy, wars, insurrections, earthquakes, floods, loss of utilities and other causes beyond the reasonable control of Lessee.
18.2 If, because of a verifiable condition of Force Majeure, either party is unable to carry out any of its obligations under this Lease (except for an obligation of either party to pay money), that party shall give written notice to the other party as promptly as practicable of the specific nature and probable duration of the claimed Force Majeure event.
The obligation of the party giving notice shall be suspended to the extent made necessary by said Force Majeure during its continuance.
The party giving notice shall use best efforts to eliminate the Force Majeure with a minimum of delay.
However, nothing herein shall obligate the Lessor or Lessee to resolve or settle any labor dispute or strike.
17
19.0 Records; Books of Account; Right to Audit.
Lessee shall keep accurate and correct books of account showing all coal loaded through the Sugar Camp Rail Load Out, together with the correct weights and selling price thereof, to which books and records Lessor shall at all reasonable times have access for verification of statements to be furnished by Lessee.
20.0 Taxes, Levies and Assessments.
20.1 Lessee shall pay all contributions, levies, taxes, or other sums, by whatever name called, with reference to all wages, benefits, or other sums paid employees of the Lessee, its agents, contractors, and assigns, whose labor enters into the construction, maintenance or operation of the Sugar Camp Rail Load Out, or the operation of the Surface Premises under this Lease in all cases where such contributions, levies, taxes, or other sums are or shall be required to be paid under any federal, state, county, or municipal unemployment act or Social Security Act; and
20.2 Lessor shall, in accordance with law, assess and pay taxes on the interests owned and/or leased by Lessor in the Surface Premises, including the Sugar Camp Rail Load Out and any mined or unmined coal therein contained, and Lessee shall pay to Lessor the full amount of such taxes, beginning with those covering the calendar year in which this Lease is effective, promptly upon receipt of Lessor�s statement therefore, such amounts to constitute and be treated as additional rental hereunder.
20.3 Lessee shall, in accordance with law, pay taxes on all machinery, structures, equipment, improvements, and other property of Lessee now or hereafter located or placed by Lessee on the Surface Premises, or any other taxes or assessments arising from Lessee�s operations on the Surface Premises at all times while this Lease or any extension hereof is in effect or Lessee is on the Surface Premises for any reason, including for purposes of restoring the property to its original condition or performing reclamation work.
Lessee shall have the right in good faith to contest or review, at its sole efforts and expense, in such manner as it deems suitable, and in Lessor�s name if desirable, any tax, charge, levy, or assessment whether general, special, ordinary, or extra-ordinary, layed, levied, assessed, or imposed upon Lessee.
21.0 Zoning.
This Lease and Lessee�s rights hereunder are subject to all applicable zoning and subdivision laws, rules, regulations, and ordinances, including any and all blasting covenants and restrictions related thereto, and the burden and cost(s) of compliance therewith shall be solely upon Lessee.
Under no circumstances whatsoever shall Lessee, its agents, employees, or assigns, seek to change any zoning

18
and/or subdivision regulations or classifications concerning the Surface Premises described herein without the express prior written approval of Lessor.
Lessee shall protect, defend, indemnify, save, and hold Lessor harmless against any consequence arising from Lessee�s failure to comply with any and all applicable zoning and/or subdivision regulations, including but not limited to any and all blasting covenants and restrictions related thereto.
22.0 Condemnation of Surface Premises.
If the Surface Premises in whole or in part, or any portion thereof or interest therein, shall be acquired or condemned by any action of eminent domain or sold in lieu thereof by or for any public or quasi-public use or purpose, which action shall serve to defeat Lessor�s or Lessee�s rights in or to the Surface Premises, then Lessor shall give notice of any such action to Lessee in writing.
In any such case, Lessee irrevocably agrees that Lessor shall have no responsibility or liability, either directly or indirectly, to Lessee to refund, reimburse, or compensate Lessee for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damage(s) or claims of such damage(s), by Lessee or others for such action or determination.
If the Surface Premises in its entirety or any portion thereof shall be acquired or condemned by any aforesaid action or determination, then at Lessee�s option, this Lease, and all of the rights granted to Lessee herein, shall cease and terminate as of the date of title vesting in any such action, determination, or proceeding.
Lessee shall have no claim against Lessor for any value of the unexpired term of this Lease.
Lessee shall have the right, at its sole efforts and expense, to contest such eminent domain action or determination and to make claim against the condemning authority (but not Lessor) for damages incurred by Lessee as a result of such action.
23.0 Ownership of the Surface Premises.
Any and all of Lessor�s interests in the Surface Premises contained or located therein or thereon, are solely the property and possessions of Lessor, and the rights and privileges granted to Lessee under this Lease are solely by virtue of Lease, and neither the rights granted to Lessee by this Lease, nor any interest(s) of Lessor in the Surface Premises, whatever they may be, in whole or in part, nor any portion of the afore described, is considered to be, and in no way shall be construed by Lessee or others to be a possession, asset, or chattel of Lessee, its principals, employees, agents, contractors, sublessees or assigns which can be sold, transferred, mortgaged, pledged, collateralized, passed, assigned, or given out in any manner whatsoever, including proceedings of a bankruptcy, without the express prior written consent of Lessor, or except as expressly authorized in Paragraph 38.0 hereof.
24.0 Challenge of Title.
It is understood and irrevocably agreed by Lessee that Lessor does not warrant the title to the Surface Premises.
In the event that any claim(s) be made or litigation instituted by any third party as to the title or ownership of Lessor in or to any portion or interest of the Surface Premises described herein, Lessor shall have the right, but not the obligation, to defend the same.
Should Lessor choose not to defend its title, Lessee shall have the right, at its option and its sole expense, to

19
defend Lessor�s title.
Upon determination by a court of competent jurisdiction in a proceeding to which Lessor is a party that Lessor�s title to any part or interest in the Surface Premises described herein is defective to such extent as to defeat Lessee�s rights under this Lease, notice by Lessor to Lessee of such determination shall operate to eliminate from this Lease any and all acreage of the Surface Premises so determined to be defective.
In such case, in no event shall Lessor be liable to Lessee for any direct or consequential damages sustained by Lessee as a result of a failure of title on Lessor�s part.
It is specifically understood and irrevocably agreed by Lessee that Lessee, its agents and assigns, have satisfied themselves as to the competency and sufficiency of Lessor�s title to the Surface Premises and the interests contained therein prior to entering into this Lease.
25.0 Lessor makes no representations, covenants, or warranties, express or implied, unto the Lessee concerning the condition of the Surface Premises, its suitability as to Lessee�s intended use or fitness for a particular purpose, and Lessee covenants and agrees that it is relying solely on its own examination and inspection of the Surface Premises without recourse against Lessor.
As-Is; No Warranty of Condition or Fitness.
26.0 Interest.
In the event of failure of either party to pay any sums of money due under this Lease after notice of the same has been delivered pursuant to Section 35 and, in the case of Lessee failure, Section 14.1, and in addition to all other rights of the parties hereunder, the party to whom such sums are owed shall have the right, without further notice, to assess interest on all such past due sums at the rate of one percent (1%) per month of the unpaid delinquent balance from the date of delinquency until paid.
Assessment of interest by either party shall in no way be deemed or construed to be a waiver of any obligation hereunder to promptly pay all sums due, when due and without demand, or to be a waiver or bar to the subsequent exercise or enforcement of any other provisions of this Lease or any other right of the parties hereunder.
27.0 Recording.
This Lease, and the terms, conditions, provisions, and covenants hereof are personal and confidential between Lessor and Lessee, and their respective affiliates, successors, and assigns, and will not be disclosed by either party except as required by law.
It is therefore understood and irrevocably agreed by Lessee that if Lessee desires to record this Lease with any court of any county in which the Surface Premises described herein are a part, Lessee will notify Lessor, in writing, of such desire and Lessor shall within thirty (30) days, provide Lessee with a �Memorandum� of this Lease for recording purposes.
The costs and efforts of recording said Memorandum of this Lease shall be paid by Lessee.
28.0 Governing Law.
This Lease shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois without regard to any conflict of law provisions.
20
29.0 Confidentiality of Information.
Lessor and Lessee acknowledge that execution and performance of this Lease may generate or provide them with access to specialized information or trade secrets of a confidential nature pertaining to the other party and its business.
Lessor and Lessee agree that they shall treat all maps, data, reports and other information relating to either party�s business as confidential and shall not divulge, transmit or otherwise disclose any such information received, except as may be required for the performance of this Lease, without the other party�s prior written consent.
30.0 Prior Agreement.
This Lease cancels and supersedes any prior agreements between the parties hereto covering the subject matter hereof.
31.0 Headings.
Paragraph headings or titles used in this Lease are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect the construction of any paragraph herein.
32.0 Forum Selection.
In the event that either party to this Lease files any action, proceeding, or counterclaim against the other on any matter whatsoever arising out of or in any way connected with this Lease or the parties� performance hereunder, or any claim of damage resulting from any act or omission of the parties, the parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of Franklin County, Illinois.
33.0 Waiver of Jury Trial.
THE PARTIES TO THIS LEASE AGREE TO, AND DO HEREBY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM BROUGHT BY EITHER OF THE PARTIES AGAINST THE OTHER ON ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE OR THE PARTIES� PERFORMANCE HEREUNDER, OR ANY CLAIM OF DAMAGE RESULTING FROM ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF THE PARTIES, OR EITHER OF THEM, IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THIS LEASE.
34.0 Limitation on Liability.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS LEASE, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE.

The termination of this Lease shall not invalidate or terminate any of the indemnities, warranties, or representations of this Lease.
37.0 No Third Party Beneficiaries.
The covenants, conditions, and terms of this Lease shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns to the exclusion of the rights of any third-party beneficiaries.
38.0 Assignment and Transfer.
Except for a Permitted Transfer, as defined below, Lessee covenants and agrees that it will not sell, assign, sublease, mortgage, pledge or otherwise transfer or encumber (collectively �Transfer�) its interest in this Lease, any rights, interests or estates created by this Lease, all or any portion of the Surface Premises, either voluntarily or by operation of law, without having first obtained the written consent of Lessor (which may be arbitrarily withheld).
(a) The prohibitions in the preceding paragraph are subject to the following Permitted Transfers.
Any Transfer to an affiliate of Lessee herein is a Permitted Transfer.
An entity is an affiliate if more than 51% of the equity interests and the voting

23
power of the entity to which this Lease is being transferred is owned or controlled by the same individual or individuals who owned or controlled more than 51% of the equity interests and the voting power of Lessee at the time of execution of this Lease.
Any Transfer to a Reputable and Prudent Coal Mining Company is a Permitted Transfer.
A Reputable and Prudent Coal Mining Company shall mean any entity, or its parent or affiliate that over the three years immediately preceding the date of such Permitted Transfer (i) has produced not less than 5 million tons of coal whether directly and/or indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiaries or contract miners or predecessor companies on an annualized basis; (ii) has not filed a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding or been declared a bankrupt; (iii) has not been blocked by any governmental authority from holding any necessary mining permits; (iv) is not known to have forfeited any leases for coal reserves as a result of uncured defaults under such leases and (v) has a net worth of $25,000,000 or more on a consolidated basis.
Any Transfer to an exchange traded public company is a Permitted Transfer.
Any Transfer to an entity which is created by the individual or individuals owning Lessee at the time of the execution of this Lease to allow the successor entity to issue shares to the public in a public offering is a Permitted Transfer.
Any Transfer to a lender or group of lenders to Lessee wherein Lessee is pledging or encumbering its leasehold interest in this Lease as security for or in return for the loan and said loan or financing is in an amount in excess of $10,000,000, is a Permitted Transfer; provided, however, that the encumbrance is expressly subject to the terms of this Lease and the lender may not subsequently Transfer such interests to any entity other than a Reputable and Prudent Coal Mining Company.
Provided further, however, that for the purposes of any transfer by a lender, a Reputable and Prudent Coal Mining Company shall include any entity, or its parent or affiliate that satisfies clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) above and has produced not less than 2 million tons of coal whether directly and/or indirectly through its wholly owned subsidiaries or contract miners or predecessor companies on an annualized basis and over the three years prior had average gross revenues from the sale of coal of $5 million or more.
(b) A Transfer of Control of Lessee or its permitted transferee (determined in accordance with the preceding provisions of this Section 38), either voluntarily or by operation of law, shall constitute a Transfer of the Lease under this section.
�Transfer of Control� as used in the foregoing shall include an outright sale, assignment or transfer of sufficient membership interests to vest more than 50% of Lessee�s membership interests (or the equity interests or voting power in its permitted transferee) in persons or entities who are different than those persons or entities which directly own more than 50% of Lessee�s membership interests as of the effective date of this Lease (or with respect to a permitted transferee, those persons or entities which directly own more than 50% of the equity interests or voting power of such permitted transferee as of the effective date of such permitted Transfer).
(c) Accordingly, a Transfer of Control shall have occurred whenever more than 50% of Lessee�s membership interests (or the equity interests or voting power in

24
its permitted transferee) shall become subject to the direct ownership of a person or entity or group of related persons or entities who are different than those persons or entities which directly own Lessee�s membership interests as of the effective date of this Lease (or with respect to a permitted transferee, those persons or entities which directly own more than 50% of the equity interests or voting power of such permitted transferee as of the effective date of such permitted Transfer).
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, a sale, assignment or transfer of any or all of the voting power or equity interests in any parent entity that directly or indirectly owns Lessee shall not constitute a prohibited assignment hereunder nor require Lessor�s consent.
(d) In the case of any Transfer or Permitted Transfer of Lessee�s interest in this Lease or the RGGS Lease, any rights, interests or estates created by this Lease or the RGGS Lease, or all or any portion of the Surface Premises, Lessee shall obtain and present to Lessor, prior to such Transfer taking place, a covenant of assumption by the transferee, wherein such transferee expressly agrees to and with Lessor to assume and be bound by all of the covenants, terms, conditions and provisions hereof (including the restrictions set forth in this Section 38) to the same extent as Lessee.
(e) Any such Transfer, Transfer of Control or Permitted Transfer shall not relieve Lessee from its obligations to comply with all of the covenants, terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.
In the event Lessor consents to any Transfer, such consent shall not relieve Lessee and/or any transferee, assignee, sublessee, etc.
from securing Lessor�s written consent to any further Transfer, other than a Permitted Transfer, nor shall any such consent be construed as a consent to any further Transfer, other than a Permitted Transfer, or as a waiver of any portion of this section or of Lessor�s rights hereunder.
(f) Upon the occurrence of any such Transfer without the prior written approval of Lessor, Lessor shall have the option to terminate this Lease by serving written notice of its election so to do.
(g) Any direct or indirect Transfer or Transfer of Control in violation of this Section 38 shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect.
(h) Lessee, its successors and assigns shall indemnify Lessor and its Affiliates from and against any and all loss or damage of any kind resulting from or arising out of any failure on the part of Lessee, its successors or assigns to comply with the requirements of this Section 38.
39.0 Binding Effect.
This Lease shall inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of and be of full and binding effect upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
25
40.0 Severability.
If any provision of this Lease or the application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this Lease shall not be affected thereby, but shall remain in full force and effect.
41.0 Entire Agreement.
This writing, together with the Coal Leases, and the Sublease, is intended by the parties to be the final, complete and exclusive statement of their agreement about the matters covered herein.
THERE ARE NO ORAL UNDERSTANDINGS, REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AFFECTING IT.
All Exhibits hereto are incorporated herein and are an integral part of this Lease.
No officer or representative of either party shall have the authority to subsequently change this Lease, orally or by course of conduct, and any subsequent change in this Lease shall not be valid unless the same be in writing and duly executed by each of the parties hereto.

Both parties further agree that this Lease shall be construed as mutually drafted, and shall not be construed against one party or the other as drafter of the Lease.
43.0 Recitals.

44.0 Purchase Option.
At any time after the expiration of the first twenty (20) years and for the remainder of the Term of this Lease and upon Ninety (90) days prior written notice, Lessee may purchase the Sugar Camp Rail Load Out for the then fair market value of the Sugar Camp Rail Load Out.
