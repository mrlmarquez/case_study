RENT.
a.
Base Monthly Rent.
Tenant shall pay Landlord monthly base rent in the initial amount in Section 1 which shall be payable monthly in advance on the first day of each and every calendar month of the Term of the Lease (�Base Monthly Rent�) provided, however, the first month�s Base Monthly Rent and Tenant�s Share of Expenses is due and payable on the Commencement Date with respect to each portion of the Premises.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4, Base Monthly Rent shall be abated for: (x) the Clear Channel Premises (except for the 351 Office, 351 Storage and 351 IDF spaces) from its Commencement Date until one hundred twenty (120) days after the Commencement Date (the � Clear ChannelRent Abatement Period�); (y) the 351 Office, 351 Storage and 351 IDF spaces from the Commencement Date until June 30, 2011 (the �351 Office/Storage/IDF Abatement Period�); and (z) the 351 Portugal Financial space from the date that Tenant notifies Landlord that it has begun the Tenant Improvement Work for that space until one hundred twenty (120)
days thereafter (the � 351 Portugal Financial Rent Abatement Period�, the Clear Channel Rent Abatement Period, 351 Office/Storage Rent Abatement Period and 351 Portugal Financial Rent Abatement Period being collectively known as the �Rent Abatement Periods�); provided, however, if prior to or during the Rent Abatement Periods, there is a default by Tenant as set forth in Section 20(a) of the Lease, then any current abatement shall immediately cease, any future abatement during the remainder of the Rent Abatement Periods shall be null and void, and Tenant shall thereafter pay full Rent for the remainder of the Term.
For purposes of Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, the parties to this Lease hereby agree to allocate the stated Rents, provided herein, to the periods which correspond to the actual Rent payments as provided under the terms and conditions of this agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, until August 1, 2012, the Base Monthly Rent for the CTI Space (defined in Section 43 below) shall remain at the rental rate, including any applicable increases, Tenant pays to Landlord pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Office Lease Agreement, dated April 3, 2000, between 401 Elliott West LLC and Tenant.
b.
Rent Adjustment.
Base Monthly Rent shall be increased periodically to the amounts and at the times set forth in Section 1(j).
c. Expenses.
The purpose of this Section 4(c) is to ensure that Tenant bears its proportionate share of all actual Expenses related to the use, Maintenance, ownership, repair or replacement, and insurance of the Premises and associated Common Areas.
Accordingly, beginning on the Commencement Date per Section 1(g) above, Tenant shall each month pay to Landlord one-twelfth (1/12) of Tenant�s Share of Expenses related to the Premises and Associated Common Areas.
As used in this Lease, �Tenant�s Share� shall mean the Premises Area, as defined in Section 1(d), divided by the total Building Area then under lease to Tenant, as defined in Section 1(e), and �Tenant�s Share of Expenses� shall mean total Expenses for the Premises and associated Common Areas, multiplied by Tenant�s Share, provided that Landlord may specially allocate individual expenses where and in the manner necessary, in Landlord�s discretion, to appropriately reflect the consumption of the expense or service.
For example where some but not all premises in a building have HVAC, Landlord may reallocate Building Expenses for HVAC to all premises utilizing HVAC to be apportioned on a per square foot basis, or could allocate to each premises utilizing HVAC the cost of maintaining that space�s individual unit.
In the event the average occupancy level of a building or the Project for any year is less than ninety five percent (95%), the actual Expenses for the building or the Project for such year shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect those costs which Landlord estimates would have been incurred, had the building or Project, as applicable, been ninety five percent (95%) occupied during such year, such that Tenant�s Share of Expenses more accurately reflects Tenant�s actual usage.
The Premises are part of a larger, multi-building project described on Exhibit B hereto.
In the event any Expenses are billed on a multi-building basis, Tenant�s Share of such Expenses shall be charged based on the ratio of the Premises Area, as defined in Section 1(d) divided by the Project Area, defined in Section 1(f).
The intent of the parties is to make rental payable by Tenant and other tenants in the Project absolutely net to Landlord assuming at least 95% occupancy, except for items expressly excluded in Section 4(c)(1)(f).
1) Expenses Defined.
The term �Expenses� shall mean all costs and expenses of the ownership, operation, maintenance, repair or replacement, and insurance of the Project (allocated on a building-by-building basis, to the extent so provided above), including without limitation, the following costs:
(a) All supplies, materials, labor, equipment, and utilities used in or related to the operation and maintenance of the Project.
(b) All maintenance, management, janitorial, legal, accounting, insurance, and service agreement costs related to the Project.

These costs may be included either based on actual expenditures or the use of an accounting reserve based on past cost experience for the Project.
(d) Amortization (along with reasonable financing charges) of capital betterments made to the Project which may be required by any government authority or which will improve the operating efficiency of the Project (provided, however, that the amount of such amortization for improvements not mandated by government authority shall not exceed in any year the amount of costs reasonably determined by Landlord in its sole discretion to have been saved by the expenditure either through the reduction or minimization of increases which would have otherwise occurred).
(e) Real Property Taxes including all taxes, assessments (general and special) and other impositions or charges which may be taxed, charged, levied, assessed or imposed upon all or any portion of or in relation to the Project or any portion thereof, any leasehold estate in the Premises or measured by Rent from the Premises, including any increase caused by the transfer, sale or encumbrance of the Project or any portion thereof.
�Real Property Taxes� shall also include any form of assessment, levy, penalty, charge or tax (other than estate, inheritance, net income, or franchise taxes) imposed by any authority having a direct or indirect power to tax or charge, including, without limitation, any city, county, state federal or any improvement or other district, whether such tax is (1) determined by the value of the Project or the Rent or other sums payable under this Lease; (2) upon or with respect to any legal or equitable interest of Landlord in the Project or any part thereof; (3) upon this transaction or any document to which Tenant is a party creating a transfer in any interest in the Project; (4) in lieu of or as a direct substitute in whole or in part of or in addition to any real property taxes on the Project; (5) based on any parking spaces or parking facilities provided in the Project; or (6) in consideration for services, such as police protection, fire protection, street, sidewalk and roadway maintenance, refuse removal or other services that may be provided by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency from time to time which were formerly provided without charge or with less charge to property owners or occupants.

or during the initial Lease Term related to the replacement of the heating and air conditioning and other Building and Project systems; and (xxii) Direct costs of managing the Garage paid to third party garage operators such as management fees, attendants, cashiers and maintenance of ticket dispensing equipment.
2) Annual Estimate of Expenses, Tenant�s Share.
When Tenant takes possession of the Premises, Landlord shall estimate Tenant�s share of Expenses for the remainder of the calendar year, and at the commencement of each calendar year thereafter, Landlord shall estimate Tenant�s Share of Expenses for the coming year by multiplying the appropriate estimated annual Building or Project Expenses by Tenant�s Share.
3) Monthly Payment of Expenses.
Tenant shall pay to Landlord, monthly in advance, as Additional Rent, one-twelfth (1/12) of the Annual Estimate of Tenant�s Share of Expenses beginning on the Commencement Date for that portion of the Premises.
As soon as practical following each calendar year, Landlord shall prepare an accounting of actual Expenses incurred during the prior calendar year and such accounting shall reflect Tenant�s Share of Expenses.
If the Additional Rent paid by Tenant under this Section 4(c)(3) during the preceding calendar year was less than the actual amount of Tenant�s Share of Expenses, Landlord shall so notify Tenant and Tenant shall pay such amount to Landlord within 30 days of receipt of such notice.
Such amount shall be deemed to have accrued during the prior calendar year and shall be due and payable from Tenant even though the term of this Lease has expired or this Lease has been terminated prior to Tenant�s receipt of this notice.
Tenant shall have thirty (30) days from receipt of such
notice to contest the amount due, failure to so notify Landlord shall represent final determination of Tenant�s Share of Expenses.
If Tenant�s payments were greater than the actual amount, then such overpayment shall be credited by Landlord to Tenant�s Share of Expenses due under this Section 4(c)(3).
If such overpayment is determined after termination of this Lease, then such overpayment shall be paid by Landlord to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the annual expense statement is completed with deduction of any remaining sums owed by Tenant to Landlord.
4) Rent Without Offset and Late Charge.
As used herein, �Rent� shall mean all monetary sums due from Tenant to Landlord.
All Base Monthly Rent shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord without prior notice or demand in advance on the first day of every calendar month, at the address shown in Section 1, or such other place as Landlord may designate in writing from time to time.
Whether or not so designated, all other sums due from Tenant under this Lease shall constitute Additional Rent, payable without prior notice or demand when specified in this Lease, but if not specified, then within thirty (30) days of demand, during which time the parties will work to resolve any good faith disagreements on the amount due.
All Rent shall be paid without any deduction or offset whatsoever except as otherwise specifically provided herein.
All Rent shall be paid in lawful currency of the United States of America.
Proration of Rent due for any partial month shall be calculated by dividing the number of days in the month for which Rent is due by the actual number of days in that month and multiplying by the applicable monthly rate.
Tenant acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to Landlord of any Rent, Additional Rent or other sums due under this Lease will cause Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of such cost being extremely difficult and impracticable to ascertain.
Such costs include, without limitation, processing and accounting charges and late charges that may be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any encumbrance or note secured by the Premises.
Therefore, if any Rent or other sum due from Tenant is not received within five (5) business days of the date due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord an additional sum equal to 5% of such overdue payment.
Landlord and Tenant hereby agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Landlord will incur by reason of any such late payment and that the late charge is in addition to any and all remedies available to the Landlord and that the assessment and/or collection of the late charge shall not be deemed a waiver of any other default.
Additionally, all such delinquent Rent or other sums, plus this late charge, which are more than thirty (30) days past due, shall bear interest at the rate of 15 percent per annum.
If the interest rate specified in this Lease is higher than the rate permitted by law, the interest rate is hereby decreased to the maximum legal interest rate permitted by law.
Any payments of any kind returned for insufficient funds will be subject to an additional handling charge of $25.00, and thereafter, Landlord may require Tenant to pay all future payments of Rent or other sums due by money order or cashier�s check.
5) Review and Audit Right.
Tenant shall have the right (no more frequently than once per calendar year) to review Landlord�s books and records pertaining to Expenses for the prior year.
Tenant may cause an audit of Landlord�s books and records which will be conducted by an independent certified public accountant designated by Tenant.
If any such audit discloses Tenant overpaid its share of Expenses for any calendar year, Landlord shall pay Tenant the amount of the overpayment within thirty (30) days after the results of the audit have been disclosed to both parties.
If any such audit discloses that Tenant underpaid its share of Expenses during any calendar year, Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of the underpayment within thirty (30) days after the results of the audit have been disclosed to both parties.
All costs and expenses of the audit shall be paid by Tenant; however if the audit shows Landlord overstated Tenant�s share of expenses for the subject calendar year by more than five percent (5%) of the amount actually payable by Tenant, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the reasonable costs and expenses of the audit within thirty (30) days of receipt of Tenant�s notice of the amount due.
Any review or audit of Landlord�s books and records pertaining to Expenses shall
occur at the office of the Building manager or at such other location in the Seattle Metropolitan Area as Landlord or its Building manager may designate and shall occur during the normal business hours of the Building manager, unless otherwise agreed by Landlord and Tenant.
The results of the audit and any information obtained by Tenant from the audit or Tenant�s review of Landlord�s books and records shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to any other person or entity, including any other tenant of the Buildings or the Project, except as required by court order or applicable law.

Furthermore, Tenant may assign this Lease to any Affiliates, or to any entity resulting from a merger or consolidation with Tenant, provided the assignee�s financial condition (i.e., net worth and liquidity) is comparable to that of Tenant immediately preceding the date of the assignment.
No interest of Tenant in this Lease shall be assignable by involuntary assignment through operation of law (including without limitation the transfer of this Lease by testacy or intestacy).
Each of the following acts shall be considered an involuntary assignment: (a) if Tenant is or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or institutes proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act in which Tenant is the bankrupt party; or if Tenant is a partnership or consists of more than one person or entity, if any partner of the partnership or other person or entity is or becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (b) if a writ of attachment or execution is levied on this Lease; or (c) if in any proceeding or action to which Tenant is a party, a receiver is appointed with authority to take
possession of the Premises.

The notices required by this Section 20 are intended to satisfy any and all notice requirements imposed by law on Landlord and are not in addition to any such requirement.
b. Landlord�s Remedies.
Landlord shall have the following remedies if Tenant is in default.
(These remedies are not exclusive; they are cumulative and in addition to any remedies now or later allowed by law).
Landlord may elect to terminate this Lease or to terminate Tenant�s right to possession of the Premises at any time.
If this Lease or Tenant�s right to possession under this Lease shall at any time be terminated, Tenant hereby covenants to immediately surrender and deliver Premises peaceably to Landlord.
No act by Landlord other than giving notice to Tenant shall terminate this Lease.
Acts of maintenance, efforts to relet the Premises, or the appointment of a receiver on Landlord�s initiative to protect Landlord�s interest under this Lease shall not constitute a termination of Tenant�s right to possession.
If Landlord terminates the Lease, Landlord has the right to recover from Tenant: (1) the worth of the unpaid Rent that had been earned at the time of termination of Tenant�s right to possession; (2) the worth of the amount of the unpaid Rent that would have been earned after the date of termination of Tenant�s right to possession; (3) any other amount, including but not limited to, expenses incurred to relet the Premises, court, attorney and collection costs, necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment caused by Tenant�s default, and (4) any amount of Rent abated pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Lease.
�The Worth,� as used for Item (1) in this Paragraph 20 is to be computed by allowing interest at the rate of 15 percent per annum.
If the interest rate specified in this Lease is higher than the rate permitted by law, the interest rate is hereby decreased to the maximum legal interest rate permitted by law.
�The Worth� as used for Item (2) in this Paragraph 20 is to be computed by discounting the amount at the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of termination of Tenant�s right of possession.
If Landlord does not terminate the Lease but terminates Tenant�s right to possession, Landlord has the right to recover from Tenant: (1) any unpaid rentals and other charges which have become payable or which may thereafter become payable; (2) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in retaking possession of the Premises; (3) any other amount, including but not limited to, expenses incurred to relet the Premises, court, attorney and collection costs, necessary to compensate Landlord for all detriment caused by Tenant�s default, and (4) any amount of Rent abated pursuant to Section 4(a) of the Lease; less (5)

If Landlord fails to make such reimbursement, then any issues relating to such default and cure shall, at either party�s election, be resolved by a single-arbitrator before the American Arbitration Association (the �AAA�) under the Arbitration Rules of the AAA modified as follows: (i) the total time from date of demand for arbitration to final award shall not exceed 25 days; (ii) the arbitrator shall be chosen by the AAA without submittal of lists and subject to challenge only for good cause shown; (iii) all notices may be by telephone or other electronic communication with later confirmation in writing; (iv) the time, date, and place of the hearing shall be set by the arbitrator in his or her sole discretion, provided that there be at least 3 days prior notice of the hearing; (v) there shall be no post-hearing briefs; (vi) there shall be no discovery except by order of the arbitrator; and (vii) the arbitrator shall issue his or her award within 7 days after the close of the hearing.

In the event Tenant does occupy any portion of the Space Pocket, such portion shall be immediately removed from the Space Pocket;

(ii) Tenant shall not be liable for the payment of Base Monthly Rent or Tenant�s Share of Expenses for the Space Pocket until the earlier of (a) the date Tenant occupies the Space Pocket or (b) twelve (12) months after CTI vacates the CTI Space;

(iii) Tenant covenants and agrees to notify Landlord immediately at such time as Tenant occupies the Space Pocket; and

(iv) once square footage is removed from the Space Pocket for any reason, it shall not be able to be included in the Space Pocket again.
As used herein, �occupancy� means any use of the floor by Tenant for other than the installation of furniture, fixtures and equipment; �occupancy� shall include use of the floor for storage or any other business use.
It is understood by both Landlord and Tenant that Tenant may not locate all its employees in a specific contiguous area of the CTI Space and therefore it may be difficult for each party to ascertain the exact amount of space Tenant is actually using, and thus makes it difficult for .both parties to agree on the Base Monthly Rent and Tenant�s Share of Expenses.
Therefore, if Tenant and Landlord cannot agree as to the amount of space Tenant is actually using, both Tenant and Landlord shall agree that each employee Tenant locates in the CTI Space (where the CTI Space is such employee�s primary office location) shall constitute usage of 250 rentable square feet (RSF).
As an example, if Tenant locates 75 employees in the CTI Space, Tenant shall agree that it is using 18,750 RSF (250 RSF X 75 employees) and thus, Tenant shall be responsible for Base Monthly Rent and Tenant�s Share of Expenses based upon 18,750 RSF of the floor being deemed occupied.
44.
CTI REDUCTION SPACE OPTION.
So long as Tenant is not in default under the terms of this Lease, Tenant shall have a one time right (the �Reduction Option�) to terminate the Lease as to the CTI Space.
The Reduction Option Date (defined below) shall not be prior to August 1, 2011 or later than August 1, 2016.
Tenant shall not have a right to exercise the Reduction Option during the term of the CTI Sublease, unless there is a monetary default by CTI under the CTI Sublease, beyond applicable notice and cure periods, and Tenant has exercised its remedies under the CTI Sublease.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall waive the requirement that Tenant exercise its remedies under the CTI Sublease if Landlord, in its reasonable judgment, determines that there is a reasonable concern, using generally accepted solvency tests applicable to entities such as CTI, about CTI�s viability or ability to fulfill any of its material obligations under the CTI Sublease.
In order to exercise its Reduction Option, Tenant shall provide Landlord with at least 12 months� prior written notice (the �Notice�) indicating its intention to exercise the option and the date which such elimination will take effect (the � Reduction Option Date�).
The Notice shall identify which portion(s) of the CTI Space Tenant intends to eliminate from the Premises (the �Reduction Space�); provided, however, that Tenant may only eliminate (a) the entirety of the third floor, and/or (b) the entirety of the fourth floor, and/or (c) either the entirety or a portion of the first floor of the CTI Space only if Tenant occupies such portion for its own use.
Should Tenant elect to eliminate a portion of the first floor CTI Space in accordance with this Section 44, the exact amount and location of such eliminated space shall be mutually acceptable to Landlord and Tenant.
If Tenant exercises its Reduction Option, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, six (6) months prior to the Reduction Option Date, the unamortized costs (based upon a twelve (12) year amortization period and an interest rate of eight percent (8%) per annum) including, but not limited to, the original tenant improvement allowance relating to that certain Amended and Restated Office Lease Agreement dated April 3, 2000, and the Tenant Refurbishment Allowance and real estate commissions in connection with this Second Amended and Restated Lease (the �Unamortized Costs�) paid by Landlord and attributable to the Reduction Space.
If Tenant exercises its Reduction Option, it shall be obligated to perform all obligations under the Lease and pay all amounts due under the Lease through the Reduction Option Date.
If Tenant has vacated the Reduction Space and Landlord enters into a lease with a third party for all or a portion of the Reduction Space prior to the Reduction Option Date, Tenant�s obligations with respect to such space shall be reduced by the amount of base monthly rent and additional rent actually paid to Landlord by the third party tenant net of Landlord�s amortization (over the term of the new lease) of costs actually incurred by Landlord in obtaining the new lease, including but not limited to new tenant improvements, commission, and space planning through the Reduction Option Date.
On the Reduction Option Date the Lease shall terminate with respect to the Reduction Space, and the relevant terms of the Lease (e.g.
Base Monthly Rent, Tenant�s Share of Expenses, Parking, Signage, to the extent applicable) shall be adjusted to reflect the elimination of the Reduction Space from the Lease.
Tenant shall not exercise its Reduction Option to relocate the business it conducts in the Reduction Space to space in any other building in the Seattle-Bellevue Metropolitan area prior to the end of the initial Lease term, other than (i) the building known as 333 Elliott, or (ii) a small satellite office of less than 5,000 rentable square feet located outside of the Seattle city limits.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Landlord and Tenant have executed this Lease as of the day and year first above written.

1.
Landlord shall at the direction of Tenant either reimburse Tenant or directly pay Tenant�s Contractor (up to the maximum amount of the Allowances) for the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work on a monthly basis, subject to the conditions outlined in Section 31 of the Lease.
Within twenty (20) days after the receipt of a draw request from Tenant�s contractor, accompanied by a signed Application and Certificate for Payment (in ALA format) from Tenant�s Architect confirming that the work covered by such draw request has been completed to its satisfaction and setting forth, inter alia, the percentage of the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work completed to date.
This payment request shall also be accompanied by partial conditional lien releases from Tenant�s Contractor covering the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work performed and/or materials and labor supplied through the date of each application for payment and full conditional lien releases from each subcontractor and supplier which has at that stage completed its work and confirmation from Tenant that its general contractor is not in default and that the percentage of work completed on the draw request is accurate.
The reimbursement shall be calculated on a percentage of completion basis less a retention as called for under the Tenant Improvement Construction Contract, but not less than five percent (5%).
After completion of one hundred percent (100%) of the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work, Landlord shall either reimburse Tenant or directly pay Tenant�s Contractor for the then unreimbursed balance of the allowance for the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work minus any mutually agreed holdback for uncompleted punch list items, within thirty (30) days following receipt of a schedule reflecting such costs, together with paid invoices supporting such costs, and satisfaction of all of the following conditions:

b) Receipt by Landlord of a certificate from the Tenant�s Architect confirming that all Tenant Refurbishment and Tenant Improvement Work has been performed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications, governing codes and ordinances and all punch list items, except mutually agreed items have been corrected;

c) Receipt by Landlord of reasonable evidence of payment by Tenant of all other costs, including extras and change orders, to its construction contract;

d) The receipt of lien releases from the general contractor and all other persons who performed work on or supplied materials for use in or otherwise have lien rights with respect to the Tenant Refurbishment orTenant Improvement Work;

f) Issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy for the Premises by the City or satisfactory evidence that said Certificate of Occupancy will be issued for the Premises within the said 30 day period;
No payment shall be made while Tenant is in default under the Lease.
If any payment is not made when due, interest shall accrue thereon at the rate provided in Section 20(b) of the Lease, but Tenant may not offset unpaid amounts against sums otherwise due Landlord under this Lease, absent a final judgment thereon.
2.
If any lien is filed with respect to the Premises during the course of construction of the Tenant Refurbishment or Tenant Improvement Work, Tenant shall notify Landlord in writing describing the cause of the lien and, if lien is for reason other than nonpayment by Landlord, the Tenant shall remove or otherwise satisfy the lien.
3.
If Tenant elects to have Landlord directly pay Tenant�s Contractor per Section IV.A.1 of this Exhibit F, then Tenant shall provide Landlord evidence satisfactory that Tenant has funds sufficient to fund all amounts above the Allowances.
