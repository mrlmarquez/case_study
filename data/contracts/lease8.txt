Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant may audit Operating Expenses for the Base Year at any time during the Term hereof.
Within fifteen (15) days after Tenant�s notice of election to perform an audit, Landlord shall afford Tenant or any of Tenant�s employees or consultants designated by Tenant, full access to such documents (including documents which may be stored in an electronic medium) (in a location within the Building) as are in Landlord�s possession or control (whether or not such documents are located in the Building) and which are necessary or desirable to conduct the audit including, without limitation work papers prepared by Landlord�s accountants, canceled checks, invoices, and such other documents as may be reasonably requested by Tenant, all of which documents shall be in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards, consistently applied (�GAAP�).

Landlord shall reasonably cooperate with Tenant as to facilitate the performance of Tenant�s audit.
Tenant agrees to conduct the audit in a manner which will cause minimum disruption to the operation of the Building and the management office of the Building.
If as a result of such audit, Tenant claims that there is an error in Landlord�s Statement (an �Expense Claim�) and Landlord does not refund to Tenant the amount of such Expense Claim within 30 days after it is furnished to Landlord, Tenant shall have the right to seek determination of such claim in the following manner.
Tenant shall provide Landlord with a list of three independent certified public accountants (identifying each accountant�s firm), whose firm, to the best knowledge of Tenant after due inquiry, is not currently providing and has not provided in the previous 3 years services to Tenant.
If possible, considering the requirements of the previous two sentences, two of the accountants shall be members of �Big Four� accounting firms, and the

8
other accountant (or accountants) shall be a member of a nationally or regionally recognized firm.
Within 10 business days after receipt from Tenant of such list, Landlord shall notify Tenant whether, to the best knowledge of Landlord after due inquiry, any of said three accounting firms on the list have provided services in the previous 3 years to Landlord (in which event the accountant from such accounting firm shall be disqualified from serving as the arbitrator), and within 15 business days after receipt from Tenant of such list, the parties shall mutually select from the remaining accountants the one who will serve as arbitrator under this paragraph.
If the parties are unable to agree on such arbitrator, the parties shall make a joint application to the local chapter of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for the appointment of such arbitrator.
Within 30 days after the parties have selected the Arbiter, Landlord and Tenant shall each submit to such accountant its position concerning the Expense Claim and all relevant information.
The chosen accountant shall make a final and binding determination of the Expense Claim.
Except as provided below to the contrary, each party shall be solely responsible for any fees that are payable to the accountant that is selected as an arbitrator, as well as any and all costs, expenses and fees incurred by Tenant and Landlord in connection with Tenant�s audit.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant within fifteen (15) days after receipt of invoice for any costs paid by Tenant to third parties performing the audit of Operating Expenses for the period in question in the event that it is determined (through mutual agreement or arbitration) that Landlord�s Statement with respect to the period in question exceeds five percent (5%) of the total paid by Tenant for such year.
Further, if it is determined that Landlord�s Statement does not exceed five percent (5%) of the total paid by Tenant for such year, then Landlord shall not be responsible for such cost costs paid by Tenant, and Tenant shall be responsible for any costs paid by Landlord to third parties relating to Tenant�s Audit.
.
(k) Landlord�s failure to bill Tenant for amounts due for Operating Expenses within one year of the expiration of the pertinent year, whether by failure to deliver Landlord�s Statement or failure to amend a mistake contained in Landlord�s Statement as delivered, will constitute an absolute waiver of Landlord�s ability to recover additional amounts for that year.
4.SALES TAX
Along with and in addition to each Rent payment under this Lease, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the sales or privilege tax required by France Statutes Section 212.031 and any amendments or replacements thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant will not be required to pay such tax on the portion of Additional Rent applicable to any utilities on which Landlord has paid sales tax to the utility provider.
Landlord will not charge more than the actual cost of any utility payable to the applicable utility provider.
Landlord will include in its estimate of Tenant�s Proportionate Share of Operating Expenses and Landlord�s Statement an itemization of the amount and type of each utility billed to Tenant, along with the amount of sale tax paid to the utility provider.

If in the Objection Notice Tenant elects to proceed with FMR Arbitration, Landlord and Tenant shall meet to attempt to determine the Fair Market Rental Rate.

When Landlord believes that the Landlord�s Work has been substantially completed, Landlord, Tenant, and Landlord�s Architect shall inspect Landlord�s Work.
(a) The Tenant Improvements shall be considered �Substantially Complete� if (following completion of the Base Building Improvements) they:
i.
Conform to the Construction Documents and are capable of being occupied for their intended purpose exclusive of touch-up, minor finish, and similar so-called �punch-list� items that do not materially interfere with Tenant�s occupancy or its business activities; and
ii.
Landlord�s architect issues a Certificate of Substantial Completion for all Landlord�s Work.
In the event of any dispute between Landlord and Tenant relating to whether the Tenant Improvements are substantially complete, or relating to what punch-list or other work is required to finally complete such construction in accordance with the Construction Documents, the reasonable decision of Landlord�s Architect (acting as a professional and not as Landlord�s agent) shall control.
(b) If Landlord�s Work is not Substantially Completed by the Target Commencement Date, the Commencement Date shall be delayed for 1 day for each such day of delay in

Exhibit C-2

(a) The date Landlord delivers the Premises with Landlord�s Work Substantial Completed; and
(b) The Target Commencement Date.

There will be no adjustment to the Commencement Date (and the Target Commencement Date shall be deemed the Commencement Date) if Substantial Completion is delayed beyond the Substantial Completion Date solely as a result of Tenant Delay.
�Tenant Delay� means any of the following:
(a) Tenant�s delay in working with Landlord�s Architect to complete the Space Plans or the Construction Documents (except if attributable to Landlord�s failure to furnish information or approvals as and when required by this Workletter);
(b) Delays resulting from change orders to the Construction Documents or any Construction Contract executed in accordance with the provisions of this Workletter.
(c) Delays attributable to the non-availability or excess procurement time for specially fabricated materials or equipment identified by Landlord as such in the Construction Documents or as part of the bidding process for the Construction Contract(s).
Any Tenant Delay must be claimed by written notice to Tenant within 24 hours after the beginning of the circumstance that constitutes a Tenant Delay or claimed within the change order documentation.
Failure to deliver the written notice within the required time waives the particular Tenant Delay.
Tenant may require Landlord (at Tenant�s expense) to work the necessary overtime to make up Tenant�s Delay.
3.4Termination Option.
If Landlord fails to achieve Substantial Completion of Landlord�s Work on or before the Substantial Completion Cancellation Date, Tenant may terminate the Lease by notice to Landlord given within fifteen (15) days after that date.
