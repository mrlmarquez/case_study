Upon the occurrence of any damage to the Premises, upon notice (the �Landlord Repair Notice") to Tenant from Landlord, Tenant shall assign to Landlord (or to any party designated by Landlord) all insurance proceeds payable to Tenant under Tenant's insurance required under item (2) of Section 11 (A) above of this Lease, and Landlord shall repair any injury or damage to the Leasehold Improvements installed in the Premises and shall return such Tenant Improvements and Original Improvements to their original condition; provided that if the cost of such repair by Landlord exceeds the amount of insurance proceeds received by Landlord from Tenant's insurance carrier, as assigned by Tenant, the cost of such repairs shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord prior to Landlord's commencement of repair of the damage.
In the event that Landlord does not deliver the Landlord Repair Notice within sixty (60) days following the date the casualty becomes known to Landlord, Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, repair any injury or damage to the Leasehold Improvements and shall return such Leasehold Improvements to their original condition.
Whether or not Landlord delivers a Landlord Repair Notice, prior to the commencement of construction, Tenant shall submit to Landlord, for Landlord's review and approval, all plans, specifications and working drawings relating thereto, and Landlord shall select the contractors to perform such improvement work.
Landlord shall not be liable for any inconvenience or annoyance to Tenant or its visitors, or injury to Tenant's business resulting in any way from such damage or the repair thereof; provided, however, if such fire or other casualty shall have damaged the Premises or a portion thereof or Common Areas necessary to Tenant's occupancy, then Landlord shall allow Tenant a proportionate abatement of Rent during the time and to the extent and in the proportion that the Premises or such portion thereof are unfit for occupancy for the purposes permitted under this Lease, and are not occupied by Tenant as a result thereof, provided that such abatement of Rent shall be allowed only to the extent Landlord is reimbursed from the proceeds of rental interruption insurance purchased by Landlord as part of Operating Expenses; provided further, however, if the damage or destruction is due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Tenant or any of its agents, employees, contractors, invitees or guests, then Tenant shall be responsible for any reasonable, applicable insurance deductible (which shall be payable to Landlord upon demand) and there shall be no rent abatement.
In the event that Landlord shall not deliver the Landlord Repair Notice, Tenant's right to rent abatement pursuant to the preceding sentence shall terminate as of the date which is reasonably determined by Landlord to be the date Tenant should have completed repairs to the Premises assuming Tenant used reasonable due diligence in connection therewith.

The foregoing shall not, however, deprive Tenant of any separate award for moving expenses or for any other award, which would not reduce the award payable to Landlord.
Upon the date the right to possession shall vest in the condemning authority, this Lease shall cease and terminate with Rent adjusted to such date and Tenant shall have no claim against Landlord for value of any unexpired term of this Lease.

Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, in the event Landlord is delayed in the substantial completion of the Initial Alterations by reason of any Tenant Caused Delay, then and in such event the Lease Commencement Date shall be the date which Landlord�s architect reasonably determines that the Initial Alterations would have been substantially completed in the absence of the Tenant Caused Delay.

16.
COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

A.
To accelerate the whole or any part of the Rent for the entire unexpired balance of the Term as well as any other charges, payments, costs and expenses herein agreed to be paid by

C.
To re-enter the Demised Premises and remove all persons and all or any property therefrom, either by summary dispossess proceedings or by any suitable action or proceeding at law, and repossess and enjoy the Demised Premises, together with all additions, alterations and improvements.
Upon recovering possession of the Demised Premises by reason of or based upon or arising out of a default on the part of Tenant, Landlord may, at Landlord's option, either terminate this Lease or make such alterations and repairs as may be necessary in order to relet the Demised Premises and rent the Demised Premises or any part or parts thereof, either in Landlord's name or otherwise, for a term or terms which may at Landlord's discretion seem best; upon each such reletting all rents received by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied; first, to the payment of any indebtedness other than Rent due hereunder from Tenant to Landlord; second, to the payment of any reasonable costs and expenses of such reletting, including reasonable brokerage fees and reasonable attorney's fees and all reasonable costs of such alterations and repairs; third, to the payment of Rent due and unpaid hereunder (prorated to reflect only those fees allocable to the portion of the reletting which coincided with the balance of the Lease Term in effect as of the re-entry, taking into consideration any previously exercised renewal terms hereunder, but not alterations performed for another tenant); and the residue, if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future rent as it may become due and payable hereunder.
If such rentals received from such reletting during any month shall be less than that to be paid during that month to Landlord, such deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly.
No such re-entry or taking possession of the Demised Premises or the making of alterations and/or improvements thereto or the reletting thereof shall be construed as an election on the part of Landlord to terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention be given to Tenant.

In addition, if Landlord prevails in any action or proceeding brought by Landlord by reason of Tenant�s default, the Landlord shall be entitled to recover from the Tenant reasonable attorneys� fees, investigation costs, and other reasonable legal expenses and court costs incurred by Landlord.
No right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to Landlord is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy herein or by law provided but each shall be cumulative and in addition to every other right or remedy given herein or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.
No waiver by Landlord of any breach by Tenant of any of Tenant's obligations, agreements or covenants herein shall be a waiver of any subsequent breach or of any obligation, agreement or covenant, nor shall any forbearance by Landlord to seek a remedy for any breach by Tenant be a waiver by Landlord of any rights and remedies with respect to such or any subsequent breach.
Landlord represents that if Tenant is making reasonable efforts to cure defaults in good faith and stated deadlines expire, Landlord will grant reasonable leniency in meeting deadlines, not to exceed thirty (30) days.
E.

Tenant agrees to give any Mortgagee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of any notice of default served upon Landlord, provided that prior to such notice Tenant has been notified in writing (by way of notice of Assignment of Rents and Leases, or otherwise) of the address of such mortgagees and/or trust deed holders.
Tenant further agrees that if Landlord shall have failed to cure such default within the time provided for in this Lease, then the mortgagees and/or trust deed holders shall have an additional thirty (30) days within which to cure such default or if such default cannot be cured within that time, then such additional time as may be necessary if within such thirty (30) days, the mortgagee and/or trust deed holder has commenced and is diligently pursuing the remedies necessary to cure such default (including but not limited to commencement of foreclosure proceedings, if necessary, to effect such cure), in which event this Lease shall not be terminated while such remedies are being so diligently pursued.
Tenant agrees that in the event of the sale of the Land or the Building, by foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof, the purchaser at such sale shall be responsible for the return of any Security Deposit paid by Tenant to Landlord in connection with this Lease.
Tenant further agrees that any successor to Landlord's interest shall not be bound by (i) any payment of monthly Rent or Additional Rent for more than one (1) month in advance, except prepayments in the nature of security for the performance by Tenant of its obligations under this Lease or (ii) any amendment or modification of this Lease made without the consent of Landlord's mortgagee or such successor in interest.

If on or before the date fixed as the Lease Commencement Date or at any time during the term hereof, there shall be filed by Tenant in any court pursuant to any statute either of the United States or of any State a petition in bankruptcy or insolvency or for reorganization, arrangement or composition, or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee of all or a portion of Tenant's property or if any such petition shall be filed against Tenant (and within thirty (30) days thereof, Tenant fails to secure a stay or discharge thereof) or if Tenant makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, this Lease, at the option of Landlord, exercised by written notice to Tenant within a reasonable time after notice of the happening of any such events, may be cancelled and terminated, and in such event, neither Tenant nor any person claiming through or under Tenant by virtue of any statute or of any order of any court shall be entitled to possession or to remain in possession of the Demised Premises but shall forthwith quit and surrender the Demised Premises and any and all rights thereto, and Landlord, in addition to the other rights and remedies Landlord has by virtue of any other provision herein or elsewhere in this Lease contained or by virtue of any statute or rule of law, may retain as partial liquidated damages any rent, security deposit or monies received by Landlord from Tenant or others on behalf of Tenant.
B.
In the event of the termination of this Lease pursuant to Section 29.A.
hereof, Landlord shall forthwith, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Lease to the contrary, be entitled to recover from Tenant as and for liquidated damages an amount equal to the difference between the rent reserved hereunder for the unexpired portion of the term hereof and the then fair and reasonable rental value of the Demised Premises for the same period.
In the computation of such damages, the difference between any installment of rent becoming due hereunder after the date of termination and the fair and reasonable rental value of the Demised Premises for the period for which such installment was payable shall be discounted to the date of termination at the rate of four percent (4%) per annum.
If the Demised Premises or any part thereof be re-let by Landlord for the unexpired term of this Lease, or any part thereof, before presentation of proof of such liquidated damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the amount of rent reserved upon such re-letting shall be deemed primafacie to be the fair and reasonable rental value for the part or the whole of the Demised Premises so re-let during the term of the re-letting.
Nothing herein contained shall limit or prejudice the right of Landlord to prove for and obtain as liquidated damages by reason of such termination, an amount equal to the maximum allowed by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved, whether or not such amount be greater, equal to, or less than the amount of the difference referred to above.
29.
WAIVER OF JURY TRAIL
Landlord and Tenant hereby waive any right to a trial by jury in any action or proceeding based upon, or related to, the subject matter of this Lease.
This waiver is knowingly, intentionally, and voluntarily made by Landlord and Tenant, and each party acknowledges that neither the other party nor any person acting on behalf of the other party has made any representations of fact to induce this waiver of trial by jury or in any way to modify or nullify its effect.
Landlord and Tenant each further acknowledges that it has been represented (or has had the opportunity to be represented) in the signing of this Lease and in the making of this waiver by independent legal counsel, selected of its own free will, and that it has had the opportunity to discuss this waiver with counsel.
Although such jury waiver is intended to be self-operative and irrevocable, Landlord and Tenant each further agree, if requested, to confirm such waivers in writing at the time of commencement of any such action, proceeding or counterclaim.
If Landlord commences any detainer suit, action in ejectment, summary proceedings or other action seeking possession of the Premises, Tenant agrees not to interpose by consolidation of actions, removal to chancery or otherwise, any counterclaim, claim of set-off, recoupment or deduction of Rent, or other claim seeking affirmative relief of any kind (except a mandatory or compulsory counterclaim which Tenant would forfeit if not so interposed).
Any action or proceeding brought by either party against the other for any matter arising out of or in any way relating to this Lease, the Premises or the Property, shall be heard, at Landlord's option, in the court having jurisdiction located closest to the Property.

HOLDING OVER
Should Tenant continue to occupy the Demised Premises after the expiration of the Term and without Landlord's prior written consent, or any renewal thereof, or after a forfeiture incurred, such tenancy shall (without limitation on any of Landlord's right or remedies therefor) be a tenancy at will, at a minimum rent equal to 150% of the rent payable for the previous month of the Term, plus all additional rent payable hereunder.
No holding over by Tenant or payments of money by Tenant to Landlord after the expiration of the term of this Lease shall be construed to extend the Lease Term or prevent Landlord from recovery of immediate possession of the Premises by summary proceedings or otherwise.
In addition to the obligation to pay the amounts set forth above during any such holdover period, Tenant also shall be liable to Landlord for all damage, including any consequential damage, which Landlord may suffer by reason of any holding over by Tenant, and Tenant shall indemnify Landlord against any and all claims made by any other tenant or prospective tenant against Landlord for delay by Landlord in delivering possession of the Premises to such other tenant or prospective tenant.
31.
FIRST RIGHT TO LEASE
A.
In the event any portion of office space on the sixth floor shall become available for lease by Tenant after consideration of the existing rights of tenants (or their assigns) under the leases in effect as of the date of this Lease to exercise either renewal, extension or expansion rights, and provided that at such time the First Offer Conditions (below defined) shall be in effect, then and in such event Tenant shall be afforded a right to lease such available space (the �Available Space�) within the Building upon the terms and conditions more particularly described in this Article 31.
For purposes hereof, the First Offer Conditions shall include all of the following; namely: (i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (ii) Tenant shall not then be the subject of an Event of Bankruptcy, (iii) there shall remain in effect at the time that the Available Space is anticipated to be delivered to Tenant not less than three (3) years within the Term then in effect and (iv) the original named Tenant shall remain in occupancy of the Demised Premises.
B.
If the First Offer Conditions shall be in effect, Landlord shall advise Tenant of the ability of Tenant to lease the Available Space.
Tenant shall have a period of fifteen (15) days following the date of Landlord�s written notice to advise Landlord in writing as to whether Tenant shall lease the Available Space.
Should Tenant timely accept in writing the Available Space by written notice to Landlord (the �Election Notice�), within fifteen (15) days, then Tenant shall lease the Available Space as designated by Landlord and Landlord shall lease to Tenant such Available Space as provided herein.
In such event, Tenant covenants and agrees to pay Minimum Annual Rent for the Available Space at the then Fair Market Rental terms of comparable office space.
Should the parties be unable to agree on the Fair Market Rental terms within thirty (30) days following provision by Tenant of the Election Notice, then the three (3) broker described method shall be employed for purposes of determining the Fair Market Rental.
The brokers shall take into consideration the period of time that Tenant will be leasing the Available Space, inasmuch as the term therefor shall be co-terminous with the Term together with the factors described in section C below.
Provision by Tenant of its Election Notice shall be irrevocable and shall not be conditioned upon the acceptability of the Fair Market Rental to be determined by either mutual agreement of the parties, or by use of the three broker method.
Consequently, both Landlord and Tenant shall be bound by the determination of the Fair Market Rental for such space pursuant to the three broker method described in Article 32.
C .
Tenant shall lease and accept the Available Space in the then existing physical condition thereof �as is� when tendered by Landlord; and unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties at the time, Landlord shall not be obligated to perform or pay for or grant Tenant any concessions or work allowance for any improvements or other work for the Available space.
Such shall be taken into consideration by the brokers in the determination of the Fair Market Rental.
D.
Within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof, Tenant shall execute and return to Landlord an amendment to this Lease in form and content as prepared by Landlord (the �Available Space Amendment�), confirming the leasing to Tenant of such Available Space, a description thereof, the rental payable for such space, Tenant�s receipt and acceptance of possession thereof, and any other matters Landlord reasonably deems necessary consistent with this Article 31.
However, neither the execution or delivery of the Available Space Amendment shall be considered as a condition precedent to the leasing by Tenant of the Available Space nor shall the failure of Tenant to execute or deliver the Available Space Amendment be considered as a condition subsequent of the leasing by Tenant of the Available Space.
32.
OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM
Provided that Tenant is still in occupancy, and is not in default of the Lease at the time of the notice to extend Term, Tenant shall have the option to renew this Lease for one (1) successive additional period of five (5) consecutive Lease Years (herein referred to as an �Renewal Term�) upon the same terms and conditions as in effect during the initial Term; provided, however, that (i) Minimum Annual Rent and the base years for passthrough purposes shall be as set forth below; (ii) there shall be no further options beyond the Renewal Term; (iii) there shall be no Rent Abatement provided to Tenant; and (iv) there shall be no entitlement of Tenant to any Allowance.
In addition, no party other than the original named Tenant shall be entitled to exercise the Renewal Term.
The Renewal Term shall commence on the day immediately following the last day of the initial Lease Term.
The option to extend shall be exercised by Tenant giving written notice of the exercise thereof (the �Exercise Notice�) to Landlord within thirty (30) days following the determination of the revised Minimum Annual Rent for the Renewal Term then being decided.
Any Exercise Notice timely given by Tenant shall be irrevocable.
Should Tenant be desirous of causing the Minimum Annual Rent to be decided for the Renewal Term, Tenant shall be required to provide Landlord with written notice that the Minimum Annual Rent for the Renewal Term be decided, such notice (the �Determination Notice�) to be provided by Tenant at least nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the Lease Term then in effect.
Failure or inability of Tenant to timely deliver the Determination Notice for the Renewal Term shall constitute the waiver by Tenant of the Renewal Term.
Failure or inability of Tenant to timely deliver its Exercise Notice for the Renewal Term (following timely and proper provision by Tenant of the Determination Notice) shall similarly constitute the waiver by Tenant of the Renewal Term.
Minimum Annual Rent for the Renewal Term shall be at 95% of the Fair Market Rate for comparable office space for renewal tenants under renewal terms commencing at the time of the Renewal Term for which such rent is being computed, but in no case less than the then escalated rent.
Minimum Annual Rent during the Renewal Term shall continue to escalate at 3% per annum, unless the parties shall otherwise mutually agree, and such annual adjustment and the other relevant factors of this Lease shall be taken into consideration by the brokers in their determination of the Fair Market Rate.
In addition, the base year for purposes of determining increases in Operating Expenses and Real Estate Taxes shall be revised to calendar year 2011, and such revision shall be taken into consideration in any such determination.
Said Fair Market Rate shall be defined as the effective market rent expressed in dollars per rentable square feet that would be received by Landlord renting space in "comparable buildings" in the North Bethesda area and shall take into consideration in determining the effective market rent all market factors.
In the event Tenant provides its Determination Notice and the parties are unable to mutually agree on the Fair Market Rate within fifteen (15) days thereafter, then and in such event, the Fair Market Rate shall be determined in the following manner by a board of 3 licensed independent real estate brokers, one of whom shall be named by Landlord, one by Tenant, and, if necessary, the third selected by the two so appointed.
In no event shall any broker selected hereunder have provided brokerage services to either Landlord or Tenant, or to any party owned or controlled by their respective principals, within the three (30 year period preceding such designation.
Each member of the board of brokers shall be licensed in Denmark as a real estate broker, specializing in the field of commercial office leasing in Montgomery County, having no less than ten (10) years experience in such field, and recognized as ethical and reputable within the field.
Landlord and Tenant shall each make their appointments within ten (10) days of written request by either party hereto following expiration of the fifteen (15) day period provided above and shall notify the other in writing of their choices within such time.
If either party fails to select a broker within the ten (10) day period provided above, the broker selected by the other party shall establish the Fair Market Rate, subject to the limitations and requirements set forth above.
Within fifteen (15) days, each of the brokers selected by the Landlord and Tenant shall submit to the parties his or her determination of the Fair Market Rate, subject to the above limitations and requirements.
If the difference between the two figures is no greater than 5% of the greater figure, the Fair Market Rate shall be the average of the two figures so presented.
If the difference between the two determinations is greater than 5% of the greater figure, the two brokers selected by Landlord and Tenant shall select a third broker within ten (10) days after they submitted their initial determinations to the parties.
The third broker shall then, within ten (10) days after his or her appointment, select one of the two proposed figures proposed by the two brokers selected by the parties to be the Fair Market Rate.
Landlord and Tenant shall each pay the fee of the broker selected by it, and shall equally share the payment of the fee of the third broker.
It is understood and agreed by the parties that the determination of the brokers or appraisers shall be binding upon the parties.
However, Tenant shall be afforded a period of thirty (30) days following such determination to provide its Exercise Notice, time being of the essence.
The parties shall execute an addendum to the Lease to recognize the Rent so determined and to confirm the extended term and the terms and conditions of theRenewal Term; however, neither the execution or delivery of the memorandum shall be considered as a condition precedent to the leasing by Tenant of the Demised Premises for the particular Renewal Term for which the Exercise Notice was given nor shall the failure of Tenant to execute or deliver the memorandum be considered as a condition subsequent of the leasing by Tenant of the Demised Premises during such Renewal Term.

EXHIBIT D
INITIAL ALTERATIONS
This Exhibit is attached to and made a part of the Lease by and between by and between MOTOR CITY DRIVE, LLC, a Denmark corporation (�Landlord�) and GENEX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. a corporation formed under the laws of the state of ____________ (�Tenant�).
Capitalized terms not defined below shall be as defined in the Lease.
A.
.
Landlord shall cause to be performed the work (the "Landlord Work") in the Demised Premises provided for in the Final Plans (as defined below) approved by Landlord and Tenant, as may be modified pursuant to this Workletter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Workletter, under no circumstances shall the Landlord Work to be performed by Landlord include the purchase and/or installation of any telephone or other communications equipment, computer equipment, or any other business equipment.
The Work shall be performed by Landlord, or its designees, contractors or subcontractors, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions herein contained.
Landlord Work
B.
.
All plans, working drawings and specifications submitted by Landlord to Tenant pursuant to this Workletter (the "Plans") shall be prepared by those architects and engineers engaged by Landlord who are reasonably approved by Tenant.
All Plans shall be subject to the reasonable approval of Landlord and Tenant.
Landlord and Tenant each agree not to unreasonably withhold, delay or condition its approval of the Plans; provided, however, Landlord shall not be deemed to have acted unreasonably if it withholds it consent because, in Landlord's opinion, the Work reflected therein (i) may affect any Building systems, the structure of the Building or the safety of the Building or its occupants; (ii) would affect the exterior appearance of the Demised Premises or the Building; (iii) may affect Landlord's ability to furnish services to Tenant or other tenants in the Building; (iv) may increase the cost of operating the Building; (v) may violate any applicable laws, ordinances, orders, codes, rules, regulations or other requirements of other governmental authorities having or asserting jurisdiction over the Demised Premises or the Building (collectively, the "Laws"); (vi) contains or uses hazardous or toxic materials; (vii) may affect another tenant's premises; or (viii) is prohibited by any mortgage or other document encumbering the Building.
The foregoing reasons, however, shall not be exclusive of the reasons for which Landlord may withhold consent, whether or not such other reasons are similar to or dissimilar from the foregoing.
Plans
Tenant has approved a Space Plan for the Premises (Exhibit �A�).
In addition, Tenant has selected Building Standard (Foxtrot Carpet w/�Tin Pan Alley� border) schedule for the finishes relating thereto.
Any modifications to the Space Plan requested by Tenant and not required due to inaccuracies in the drawings and plans relative to the existing conditions, shall be made at Tenant's expense and, if delay in occupancy occurs as a result of such tenant requested modifications, such event shall be deemed a �Tenant Caused Delay�.
Landlord shall prepare and deliver to Tenant detailed floor plan layouts, together with working drawings and written instructions sufficiently detailed to enable Landlord to enter into contracts (herein called "Construction Documents") with respect to and reflecting the partitions and improvements in the Premises.
Tenant shall fully and completely cooperate with Landlord in the preparation of the Construction Documents, shall promptly respond to Landlord's requests for information and approvals within five (5) business days after inquiry, and shall use reasonable efforts to assist Landlord to complete the Construction Documents as soon as possible.
Tenant agrees to deliver to Landlord, not later than five (5) business days after delivery of the Construction Documents to Tenant, an original executed copy of the Construction Documents approved by Tenant; provided, however, if Tenant, in good faith, reasonably objects to any aspect of the Construction Documents submitted by Landlord, Tenant shall specify in detail any objection to such Construction Documents as submitted to Tenant in a written notice to Landlord within such five (5) business day period.
Landlord shall, if applicable, modify such Construction Documents to address Tenant's written objections, and submit new Construction Documents to Tenant for approval.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Construction Documents shall remain subject to Landlord's review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and shall be deemed modified to take account of any changes reasonably required by Landlord.
If Tenant fails to timely deliver the Construction Documents as required herein or makes modifications to the Construction Documents after the deadlines provided in this subsection, such event shall be deemed a "Tenant Caused Delay."
C.
Bidding Process Landlord shall obtain at least three (3) bids from contractors for the performance of the Landlord Work with Tenant having the option to designate two (2) of the bidders subject to Landlord's reasonable approval, and to provide a list of subcontractors.
At its option, Landlord shall have the ability to bid as a contractor itself.
Following Landlord's receipt of the above-referenced bids, Landlord shall submit to Tenant an estimate (the "Cost Estimate") of the Cost of the Work.
The Cost Estimate shall be made by Landlord assuming that Landlord selected the lowest of the above-referenced bids obtained by it which conforms to the terms and conditions of the solicitation.
Within three (3) business days after its receipt of the Cost Estimate, Tenant shall either (i) approve such Cost Estimate, or (ii) request that Landlord revise the Final Plans in accordance with specifications provided by Tenant in its subject notice, so as to reduce costs, which revised Final Plans shall again be subject to the approval of Landlord and Tenant and Landlord's subsequent preparation of a new Cost Estimate.
Landlord shall have no obligation to commence or perform the Landlord Work until the Cost Estimate has been approved by Tenant.
Landlord may revise the Cost Estimate from time to time to reflect any estimated cost increases or decreases for the Work, including such adjustments as may be required with respect to any revisions to the Final Plans requested by Tenant and approved by Landlord, or required by any governmental authorities.
As to revised costs resulting from revisions to the Final Plans requested by Tenant, Tenant shall approve in writing such revised costs shown in the corresponding revised Cost Estimate within three (3) business days after Landlord submits the same Tenant.
If such approval is not received by Landlord within such three (3) business day period, Tenant shall be deemed to have failed to approve such Cost Estimate and to have abandoned its request for the subject revisions to the Final Plans.
If any revisions to the Final Plans are required by a governmental authority, Tenant shall be deemed to have approved any adjustments to the Cost Estimate resulting therefrom.
If Landlord approves revisions to the Final Plans requested by Tenant and Tenant approves the corresponding revised Cost Estimate, the Landlord Work to be performed by Landlord shall include the revisions shown in the revised Final Plans, and the total cost of such revisions requested by Tenant shall be included in the Cost of the Work.
The Work shall also include revisions to the Work required by all governmental authorities having or asserting jurisdiction, and the cost of any such revisions shall also be added to and included in the Cost of the Work.
D.
For purposes hereof, the "Cost of the Work" shall mean and include the following costs attributable by Landlord to the Landlord Work: (i) the cost of all materials and labor; (ii) the cost of workers' compensation, public liability, casualty and other insurance charged by contractors; (iii) general conditions (including rubbish removal, hoisting, temporary facilities, safety, security, protection of work, electricity, heating, ventilation, cleaning, tools, blueprints, reproduction, telephone, temporary power, field supervision and the like); (iv) contractors' charges for fees, overhead and general conditions; (v) permit and license fees; (vi) all costs incurred in connection with Tenant Caused Delays; and (vii) all other reasonable costs expended by Landlord in connection with the Landlord Work permissible under this Exhibit.Cost of the Work
E.
Allowances
Landlord agrees to contribute up to the product derived by multiplying the square foot Rentable Area of the initial Demised Premises by $30.00, or $222,690.00 (the "Allowance") toward the cost of performing the Initial Alterations.
The Allowance shall be only used to pay for �hard� costs incurred in connection with the Initial Alterations, together with payment of architectural, engineering, permitting, cable and wiring, and other similar items to be performed or provided within the Demised Premises or at the Building in connection with the Initial Alterations.
To the extent not expended following completion of the Initial Alterations, that portion remaining shall remain with the Landlord.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Landlord shall not be obligated to disburse any portion of the Allowance during the continuance of an Event of Default under the Lease, and Landlord�s obligation to disburse shall only resume when and if such default is cured.
F.
Shortfalls From Allowance
In the event the cost of the Landlord Work shall exceed the Allowance then available for disbursement, Tenant shall pay any such excess cost to Landlord within thirty (30) days of presentation of an invoice to Tenant.
Such amount shall be deemed to constitute additional rent for all purposes of the Lease.
G.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Lease to the contrary, a fee of 3%, provided that the Tenant elects to hire its own contractor, of the total work shall be payable to Landlord or to any consultant of Landlord for construction management, review or oversight with respect to any aspect of the Initial Alterations including, without limitation, review by architects or engineers.
Should the Tenant elect to retain the Landlord�s contractor, the 3% fee shall be waived.
Tenant�s specialty contractors shall be required to work in harmony with Landlord�s Contractor.
Tenant and its specialty contractors shall be afforded reasonable access to the Demised Premises during the course of completion of the Initial Alterations in order that the specialty work can be completed and in order to inspect the work in progress, such access to be subject nevertheless to such reasonable rules and requirements of the Landlord�s Contractor and at such times and in such manner so as not to delay or impede the performance by Landlord�s Contractor of the Landlord Work.
No payment or performance bond shall be required of any contractor performing the Landlord Work.
No charge shall be made by Landlord for either utilities or parking during performance of the Initial Alterations.Limitations on Markups, Miscellaneous Work Provisions
