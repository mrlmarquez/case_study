(iv) As long as Landlord has previously been provided a copy of a Leasehold Mortgage, no voluntary amendment, cancellation, termination, surrender or modification of this Lease shall be effective as to such Leasehold Mortgagee unless the Leasehold Mortgagee has consented thereto in writing.
(v) No Leasehold Mortgagee, simply by virtue of its lien on the Tenant�s Leasehold Estate, shall be deemed to have assumed any of the obligations or liabilities of Tenant hereunder.
Any Leasehold Mortgagee (or its assignee or designee) who takes title to the Tenant�s Leasehold Estate or enters into a new lease with Landlord pursuant to this Section shall be responsible for the performance of Tenant�s obligations under this Lease or such new

PURPOSE:
To assist patients possessing minimal monetary resources to resolve financial obligations for healthcare services.
POLICY:
Charitable discounts will be based on the applicant�s inability to pay and will not be determined on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, or national origin.
To the extent the resources of Muskogee Regional Medical Center (MRMC) permit, healthcare services shall be available to all eligible individuals so as to render necessary medical services, regardless of the applicant�s ability to pay.
The medical center may, however, refer an individual to alternative programs or services within the community where appropriate programs and services are available and where such referrals do not place an undue burden on the patient or family.
The medical center will also pursue and assist the individual in pursuing alternative sources of payment from other payer sources.
Both of these actions are intended to allow the medical center to provide substantially higher level of necessary charitable services within the limits of our resources.
Confidentiality of information and individual dignity will be maintained for all who seek charitable services at the medical center.
PROCEDURE:
All applications for charity consideration are referred to the Patient Financial Services department.
Request for consideration can originate from the physician, patient, responsible
Healthcare Assistance Program

party, family member, or associate of the family.
Referral can also originate from any employee or member of the medical center staff.
The notification of need can be either verbal or by written communication.
I.
The patient, or a representative or responsible party will make application to any possible sources for reimbursement such as DHS, Victim of Crime, SSI or other available programs.
Assistance in the application process can be provided by medical center staff or contract personnel.
II.
A Healthcare Assistant Program Application and valid documentation of income will be required from each patient, his representative or responsible party requesting charity care consideration.
III.
To be eligible for healthcare assistance, family income must be at or below established medical center income guidelines.
A.
Family income is considered to be all income for all persons living in the same household.
Size of family is based on all persons living in the same household including students or others claimed on income tax return.
Proof of income must accompany the application and additional information and documentation may be required prior to determination.
B.
Income guidelines will be based upon the yearly rates as published in the Federal Register.
C. Approval and adjustment will be made only after all other sources of reimbursement have been exhausted.
Non-compliance in making application to other sources will negate eligibility for charitable consideration.
IV.
For those patients falling outside the income guidelines, healthcare assistance consideration can be determined by an evaluation and analysis of the patient�s income, other income sources, disposable assets, and the patient�s ability to pay a portion of their medical bill.
For an expense to income analysis, expenses must be at least 90% of income.
Expenses considered in the analysis are as follows.
1.
Rent/Mortgage

2.
Utilities

3.
Food

4.
Transportation Fees

5.
Prescription medication, Durable Medical Equipment

6.
Other medical expenses

7.
Insurance premiums

8.
Taxes
V. For those patients who are eligible for Medicaid benefits and receive medically necessary services that are deemed non-covered for reimbursement by state Medicaid guidelines, a charitable adjustment will be made at 100%.

VI.

VII.

Non-compliance with the arrangements will result in the account being classified Bad Debt with collection agency assignment.
VIII.

C. 50% Charity � Income over 2 times and including 2-1/2 times poverty guidelines.
IX.
The medical center reserves the right to reconsider its determination under any of, but not limited by the following conditions.
A.
If the patient, his representative, or responsible party should refuse to cooperate in furnishing current financial information to assist in a fair determination.
B.
If the patient, his representative or responsible party should refuse to make application or not fully cooperate in completing application requirements for any amounts receivable from other available payer sources.
